Order parameter (OP) of a superconducting condensate with FMP has the form
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{\vb{q}} (\vb{r}) = \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert e^{i \vb{q} \vb{r}}
\end{equation}
where \(\vb{q}\) is the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs.

FMP is well known from Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) theory, where the single-momentum phase used here corresponds to FF-type pairing. \todo{What does that mean? More details on FFLO theory}

\section{Ginzburg-Landau description}

First: Motivate how the FMP constraint relates to \(\lambda_L\) and \(\xi_0\).

GL low-order expansion of the free energy density \(f_{\mathrm{GL}}\) in terms of the FMP-constrained OP reads
\begin{equation}
    1
\end{equation}
\todo{Fill in equation}

The temperature dependent correlation length \(\xi\) appears as the natural length scale of the amplitude mode (\(\propto \alpha\)) and kinetic energy term
\begin{equation}
    \xi (T) =
\end{equation}
\todo{Fill in equation}
with the zero temperature value \(\xi_0\) being the coherence length.

%“normal (anomalous) Green function G (F) components on imaginary time τ take over the q-dependence.”

%“local anomalous Green function |Ψq| ≡ [Floc q (τ = 0−)]αα = X k ⟨cαk+ q 2 ↑cα−k+ q 2 ↓⟩” From microscopic treatment we get order parameter, the from that we get penetration depth and coherence length in GL theory?
