\section{Coherence length and penetration depth in strongly correlated superconductors}

\cite{wittBypassingLatticeBCSBEC2024}

Order parameter (OP) of a superconducting condensate with FMP has the form
\begin{equation}
    \Psi_{\vb{q}} (\vb{r}) = \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert e^{i \vb{q} \vb{r}}
\end{equation}
where \(\vb{q}\) is the center-of-mass momentum of Cooper pairs.

FMP is well known from Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) theory, where the single-momentum phase used here corresponds to FF-type pairing. \todo{What does that mean? More details on FFLO theory}

\section{Ginzburg-Landau description}

First: Motivate how the FMP constraint relates to \(\lambda_L\) and \(\xi_0\).

GL low-order expansion of the free energy density \(f_{\mathrm{GL}}\) in terms of the FMP-constrained OP reads
\begin{equation}
    1
\end{equation}
\todo{Fill in equation}
\todo{More details on GL theory in general}


The temperature dependent correlation length \(\xi\) appears as the natural length scale of the amplitude mode (\(\propto \alpha\)) and kinetic energy term
\begin{equation}
    \xi (T) =
\end{equation}
\todo{Fill in equation}
with the zero temperature value \(\xi_0\) being the coherence length.

%“normal (anomalous) Green function G (F) components on imaginary time τ take over the q-dependence.”

%“local anomalous Green function |Ψq| ≡ [Floc q (τ = 0−)]αα = X k ⟨cαk+ q 2 ↑cα−k+ q 2 ↓⟩” From microscopic treatment we get order parameter, the from that we get penetration depth and coherence length in GL theory?

\section{Phase transitions and broken symmetry}

Following~\cite[ch. 11]{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015}.

\subsection{Order parameter concept}

Landau theory: phase transitions (e.g.\ iron becomes magnetic, water freezes, superfluidity/superconductivity) are associated with the development of an order parameter when the temperature drops below the transition temperature \(T_C\) \todo{This works also for phase transitions not dependent of temperatures, so e.g.\ in pressures?}
\begin{equation}
    \vert \psi \vert =
    \begin{cases}
        0\;,\; T > T_C \\
        \vert \psi_0 \vert > 0 \;,\; T < T_C
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Landau theory does not need microscopic expression for order parameter, it provides corse-grained description of the properties of matter.
The order parameter description is good at length scales above \(\xi_0\), the coherence length (e.g.\ size of Cooper pairs for SC).

\subsection{Landau theory}

\todo{Rest of Landau theory}

Landau theory

Going from a one to a \(n\)-component order parameters, we can actually

Particularly important example: complex or two component order parameter in superfluids and superconductors:
\begin{equation}
    \psi = \psi_1 + \iu \psi_2 = \vert \psi \vert e^{\iu \phi}
\end{equation}
The Landau free energy takes the form:
\begin{equation}
    f[\psi] = r(\psi^* \psi) + \frac{u}{2} (\psi^* \psi)^2
\end{equation}
Figure~\ref{fig:Landau free energy mexican hat potential} shows the Landau free energy as function of \(\psi\).

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{images/landau free energy mexican hat}
    \caption{Mexican hat potential}
    \label{fig:Landau free energy mexican hat potential}
\end{figure}

In this `Mexican hat' potential: order parameter can be rotated continuously from one broken-symmetry state to another.
If we want the phase to be rigid, we need to introduce an
There is a topological argument for the fact that the phase is rigid.
This leads to Ginzburg-Landau theory.
Will see later: well-defined phase is associated with persistent currents or superflow.

\subsection{Ginzburg-Landau theory I: Ising order}

Landau theory: energy cost of a uniform order parameter, more general theory needs to account for inhomogenous order parameters, in which the amplitude varies or direction of order parameter is twisted -> GL theory.
First: one-component, `Ising' order parameter.
GL introduces additional energy \(\delta f \propto \vert \Delta \psi \vert^2\), \(f_{GL} [\psi, \Delta \psi] = \frac{s}{2} \vert \Delta \psi \vert^2 + f_L [\psi(s)]\), or in full:
\begin{equation}
    f_{GL} [\psi, \Delta \psi, h] = \frac{s}{2} (\Delta \psi)^2 + \frac{r}{2} \psi^2 + \frac{u}{4} \psi^4 - h \psi
\end{equation}
\todo{What is the \(h\) here?}
GL theory is only valid near critical point, where OP is small enough to permit leading-order expansion.
\todo{length scale/correlation length}

\subsection{Ginzburg-Landau theory II: complex order and superflow}

Now: G-L theory of complex or two-component order parameters, so superfluids and superconductors.
Heart of discussion: emergence of a `macroscopic wavefunction', where the microscopic field operators \(\hat{\psi(x)}\) acquire an expectation value:
\todo{What exactly are field operators again?}
\begin{equation}
    \braket{\psi (x)} = \psi (x) = \vert \psi (x) \vert e^{\iu \theta(x)}
\end{equation}
Magnitude determines density of particles in the superfluid:
\todo{More info on that? Does that come later in chapter?}
\begin{equation}
    \vert \psi(x) \vert^2 = n_s (x)
\end{equation}
Twist/gradient of phase determines superfluid velocity:
\begin{equation}
    \vb{v}_s (x) = \frac{\hbar}{m} \Delta \phi (x)
\end{equation}
We will derive this later in the chapter.
Counterintuitive from quantum mechanics: GL suggested that \(\Phi(x)\) is a macroscopic manifestation of a macroscopic number of particles condensed into precisely the same quantum state.
Emergent phenomenon, collective properties of mater not a-priori self-evident from microscopic physics.

GL free energy density for superfluid (with one added term in comparison to Landau energy):
\begin{equation}
    f_{GL} [\psi, \Delta \psi] = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \vert \Delta \psi \vert^2 + r \vert \psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \psi \vert^4
\end{equation}
Interpreted as energy density of a condensate of bosons in which the field operator behaves as a complex order parameter.
\todo{energy density of bosonic field? -> for comparison!}
Gives interpretation of gradient term as kinetic energy:
\begin{equation}
    s \vert \Delta \psi \vert^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \braket{\Delta \hat{\psi}^{\dagger} \Delta \hat{\psi}} \implies s = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}
\end{equation}
As in Ising order: correlation length/GL-coherence length governs characteristic range of amplitude fluctuations of the order parameter:
\begin{equation}
    \xi = \sqrt{\frac{s}{\vert r \vert}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2m \vert r \vert}} = \xi_0 (1 - \frac{T}{T_C})^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
\todo{Compare with Ising order, especially dependence on \(T\)}
where \(\xi_0 = \xi(T=0) = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m a T_C}}\) is the coherence length.
Beyond this length: only phase fluctuations survive.
\todo{Compare with Ising order. Is that derived or postulated?}
Freeze out fluctuations in amplitude (no \(x\)-dependence in amplitude) \(\psi(x) = \sqrt{n_s} e^{\iu \phi(x)}\), then \(\Delta \psi = \iu \Delta \phi \psi\) and \(\vert \Delta \psi \vert^2 = n_s (\Delta \phi)^2\), dependency of kinetic energy on the phase twist is (bringing it into the form \(\frac{m}{2} v^2\)):
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\hbar^2 n_s}{2m} (\Delta \phi)^2 = \frac{m n_s}{2} (\frac{\hbar}{m} \Delta \phi)^2
\end{equation}
So twist of phase results in increase in kinetic energy, associated with a superfluid velocity:
\begin{equation}
    \vb{v}_s = \frac{\hbar}{m} \Delta \phi
\end{equation}

\todo{Coherent states/Interpretation of states/Off-diagonal long-range order}

Phase rigidity and superflow: in GL theory, energy is sensitive to a twist of the phase.
Substitute \(\psi = \vert \psi \vert e^{\iu \phi}\) into GL free energy, gradient term is:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \psi = ()
\end{equation}

\todo{Here: particle-current operator, especially for coherent state, connection with phase twist}
