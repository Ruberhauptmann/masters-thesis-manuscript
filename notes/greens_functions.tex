From TRIQS tutorial:
As you can see, the behavior of the imaginary part is very different for the two values of $U$. When
$U$ is small, the system is a metal and the imaginary part extrapolated to zero goes to a finite value.
Instead, for large $U$, the system is a Mott insulator and the imaginary part goes to zero. The reason
is that the extrapolation to zero is directly proportional to the density of states at the chemical
potential. If the system is gapped, the density is zero; if the system is a metal, there is spectral
weight and the density is finite. Therefore, even on the Matsubara axis, one has a way to decide if the
system is metallic or not.


Most general non-interacting electronic Hamiltonian in second quantization:
\begin{equation}
    H_0 = \sum_{i, j, \sigma}
\end{equation}
with lattice coordinates \(i, j\) and spin \(\sigma\).

One particle Green's function (many-body object, coming from the Hubbard model):
\begin{equation}
    G(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n) = \frac{1}{\iu \omega_n + \mu - \epsilon_{\vb{k}} - \Sigma(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)}
\end{equation}
with the self energy \(\Sigma(\iu \omega_n)\) coming from the solution of the effect on-site problem:

The Dyson equation
\begin{equation}
    G(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n) = \left( G_0 (\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n) - \Sigma(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
relates the non-interacting Greens function \(G_0 (\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)\) and the fully-interacting Greens function \(G (\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)\) (inversion of a matrix!).
