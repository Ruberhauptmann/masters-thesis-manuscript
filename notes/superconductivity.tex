\chapter{Superconductivity}\label{ch:superconductivity}

Superconductivity is an example of an emergent phenomenon: the SchrÃ¶dinger equation describing all interactions between electrons gives no indication that there exists parameters for which the electrons condense into phase coherent pairs.
In this chapter we review theoretical concepts needed for understanding superconductivity and introduce the tools used to study superconductivity in the later chapters.
There are many textbooks covering these topics which can be referenced for a more detailed treatment, such as refs. \cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015, tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity1996, bruusManyBodyQuantumTheory2004, larkinTheoryFluctuationsSuperconductors2005, bennemannSuperconductivity2008}.

Macroscopially, the superconducting state can be described by a spontaneous breaking of a \(U(1)\) phase rotation symmetry that is associated with an order parameter.
Theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking and associated phase transitions is Ginzburg-Landau theory discussed in \cref{sec:Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity}.
Ginzburg-Landau theory introduces two length scales: the coherence length \(\xi_0\) describing the length scale of amplitude variations of the order parameter and the London penetration depth \(\lambda_L\), which is connected to energy cost of phase variations of the order parameter.
The interplay of these length scales determine 
\todo{What is influenced by length scales? See Niklas 2024 npj}
To this end, \cref{sec:Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity}  introduces a theoretical framework based on Cooper pairs with finite momentum \cite{wittBypassingLatticeBCS2024} that will be used in later chapters to calculate these length scales from microscopic theories.

Ginzburg Landau theory is a macroscopic theory, but it can be connected to microscopic theories: if a theory finds an expression for the order parameter describing the symmetry breakdown, it can be connected to quantities expressed by Ginzburg-Landau theory, such as the superconducting current.
One such theory to describe superconductivity from a microscopic perspective is \glsxtrfull{bcs} theory in \cref{sec:bcs-theory}.
A method to treat local interactions non-perturbatively is \glsxtrfull{dmft}. \Cref{sec:Dynamical Mean-Field Theory} briefly introduces the Greens function method to treat many-body problems and outlines the \glsxtrshort{dmft} self-consistency cycle.

\section{Ginzburg-Landau Theory of Superconductivity}\label{sec:Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity}

\todo{Introduction with more history and what will be tackled in this section}

This review partially follows the introduction given in refs.~\cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015, beekmanIntroductionSpontaneousSymmetry2019}.

\subsection{\glsxtrlong{ssb} and Order Parameter}

Symmetries are a powerful concept in physics.
Noethers theorem \cite{noetherInvarianteVariationsprobleme1918} connects the symmetries of physical theories to associated conservation laws.
An interesting facet of symmetries in physical theories is the fact, that a ground state of a system must not necessarily obey the same symmetries of its Hamiltonian, i.e. for a symmetry operation that is described by a unitary operator \(U\), the Hamiltonian commutes with \(U\) (which results in expectation values of the Hamiltonian being invariant under the symmetry operation) but the states \(\ket{\phi}\) and \(U \ket{\phi}\) are different.
This phenomenon is called \glsxtrfull{ssb} and the state \(\ket{\phi}\) is said to be symmetry-broken.

One consequence of this fact is that for a given symmetry-broken state \(\ket{\phi}\), there exists multiple states that can be reached by repeatedly applying \(U\) to \(\ket{\phi}\) and all have the same energy.
To differentiate the symmetry-broken states an operator can be defined that has all these equivalent states as eigenvectors with different eigenvalues and zero expectation value for symmetric states.
This is the microscopic notion of an order parameter.

The original notion of an order parameter was motivated from macroscopic observables that can then be related to the microscopic order parameter operator introduced above.
Macroscopically we characterize the symmetry breaking by an order parameter \(\Psi\) which generally can be a complex-valued vector that becomes non-zero below the transition temperature \(T_C\)
\begin{equation}
	\vert \Psi \vert =
	\begin{cases}
		0 & T > T_C \\
		\vert \Psi_0 \vert > 0 & T < T_C
	\end{cases} \;.
\end{equation}

In the example of a ferromagnet, a finite magnetization of a material is associated with a finite expectation value for the \(z\)-component of the spin operator, \(m_z = \braket{\ope{S_z}}\).
The order parameter describes the `degree of order` \cite{landauTheoryPhaseTransitions1937}.
Similarly to a magnetically ordered state, the SC state is characterized by an order parameter.
The theory of phase transitions in superconductors was developed by Ginzburg and Landau \cite{ginzburgTheorySuperconductivity1950}.
Landau theory and conversely Ginzburg-Landau theory is not concerned with the the microscopic properties of the order parameter, but describes the changes in thermodynamic properties of matter with the development of an order parameter.

\subsection{Landau and Ginzburg-Landau Theory}\label{sub:Landau and Ginzburg-Landau Theory}

The free energy is a thermodynamic quantity:
\begin{equation}
	F = E - T S
\end{equation}
with the energy of the system \(E\), temperature \(T\) and entropy \(S\).
A system in thermodynamic equilibrium has minimal free energy.
The fundamental idea underlying Landau theory is to write the free energy \(F[\Psi]\) as function of the order parameter \(\Psi\) and expand it as a polynomial:
\begin{equation}
	F[\Psi] = \frac{r}{2} \Psi^2 + \frac{u}{4} \Psi^4 \;.
\end{equation}
Provided the parameters \(r\) and \(u\) are greater than \(0\), there is a minimum of \(F[\Psi]\) that lies at \(\Psi = 0\).
Landau theory assumes that at the phase transition temperature \(T_C\) the parameter \(r\) changes sign, so it can be written in first order as
\begin{equation}
	r = a(T - T_C) \;.
\end{equation}

\todo{Work over graphic for mexican hat potential}

	\label{fig:Landau free energy and Ginzburg-Landau free energy}
\end{figure}

\Cref{sfig:Landau free energy} shows the free energy as a function of a single-component, real order parameter \(\Psi\) and it illustrates the essence of Landau theory: there are two cases for the minima of the free energy \(F\)
\begin{equation}
	\Psi = \begin{cases}
		0 & T \geq T_C \\
		\pm \sqrt{\frac{a (T_C - T)}{u}} & T < T_C
	\end{cases} \;,
\end{equation}
so there is a for \(T < T_C\) there are two minima corresponding to ground states with broken symmetry.
When the order parameter can be calculated from some microscopic theory, the critical temperature \(T_C\) can be extracted from the behavior of the order parameter near \(T_C\) via a linear fit of
\begin{equation}
	\vert \Psi \vert^2 \propto T_C - T \;.
\end{equation}

Generalizing this from a one to an \(n\)-component order parameters is straightforward.
One example is the complex or two component order parameter that will become important for 
\begin{equation}
	\Psi = \Psi_1 + \iu \Psi_2 = \vert \Psi \vert e^{\iu \phi} \,.
\end{equation}
The Landau free energy then takes the form
\begin{equation}
	F [\Psi] = r \Psi^* \Psi + \frac{u}{2} (\Psi^* \Psi)^2 = r \vert \Psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \Psi \vert^4
\end{equation}
with again
\begin{equation}
	r = a(T_C - T) \;.
\end{equation}
Instead of the two minima, the free energy here is rotational symmetry, because it is independent of the phase of the order parameter: 
\begin{equation}
	F [\Psi] = f [e^{\iu a} \Psi] \;.
\end{equation}
This gives the so called `Mexican hat' potential shown in \cref{sfig:Ginzburg Landau free energy}.
In this potential, the order parameter can be rotated continuously from one broken-symmetry state to another.

In 1950, Ginzburg and Landau published their theory of superconductivity based on Landaus theory of phase transitions \cite{ginzburgTheorySuperconductivity1950}.
Where Landau theory as described above has an uniform order parameters, Ginzburg-Landau theory accounts for it being inhomogeneous, so an order parameter with spatially varying amplitude or direction.
This in turn leads to the order parameter developing a fixed phase, which is the underlying mechanism of the superflow in superconductors.

Ginzburg-Landau theory can be developed for a general \(n\)-component order parameter, but in superfluids and superconductors the order parameter is complex, i.e. two-component.
The Ginzburg-Landau free energy for a complex order parameter is
\begin{equation}
	F_{\mathrm{GL}} [\Psi, \adif{\Psi}] = s \vert \adif{\Psi} \vert^2 + r \vert \Psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \Psi \vert^4 \;,
\end{equation}
where the gradient term \(\adif{\Psi}\) is added in comparison to Landau energy.
\todo{Work over paragraph}

In GL theory, energy is sensitive to a twist of the phase.
Substitute \(\psi = \vert \psi \vert e^{\iu \phi}\) into GL free energy, gradient term is:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \psi = (\Delta \vert \psi \vert + \iu \Delta \phi \vert \psi \vert) e^{\iu \phi}
\end{equation}
So:
\begin{equation}
	f_{GL}  = s \vert \psi \vert^2 (\Delta \phi)^2 + \left[ s (\Delta \vert \psi \vert)^2 + r \vert \psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \psi \vert^4 \right]
\end{equation}
The second term describes energy cost of variations in the magnitude of the order parameter.
The first term describes energy cost of variations in the phase of the order parameter.
The dominating fluctuation is determined by the ratio of the factors \(s\) and \(r\), which has the dimension \(\mathrm{Length}^2\), from which define the correlation length
\begin{equation}
	\xi = \sqrt{\frac{s}{\vert r \vert}} = \xi_0 \left(1 - \frac{T}{T_C}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
where \(\xi_0 = \xi(T=0) = \sqrt{\frac{s}{a T_C}}\) is the coherence length.
Beyond this length scale: only phase fluctuations survive.

\todo{Better introduction}

In most materials: Cooper pairs do not carry finite center-of-mass momentum.
In presence of e.g.\ external fields or magnetism: SC states with FMP might arise.

Theory/procedure in the paper: enforce FMP states via constraints on pair-center-of-mass momentum \(\vb{q}\), access characteristic lenght scales \(\xi_0, \lambda_L\) through analysis of the momentum and temperature-dependent OP\@.
FF-type pairing with Cooper pairs carrying finite momentum:
\begin{equation}
	\psi_{\vb{q}} (\vb{r}) = \vert \psi_{\vb{q}} \vert e^{\iu \vb{q} \vb{r}}
\end{equation}
Then the free energy density is
\begin{equation}
	f_{GL} [\psi_{\vb{q}}] = \alpha \vert \psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2 + \frac{b}{2} \vert \psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^4 + \frac{\hbar^2 q^2}{2 m^*} \vert \psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2
\end{equation}
Stationary point of the system:
\begin{equation}
	\fdv{f_{GL}}{\psi_{\vb{q}}^*} = 2 \psi_{\vb{q}} \left[\alpha (1 - \xi^2 q^2) + b \vert \psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2\right] = 0
\end{equation}
which results in the \(\vb{q}\)-dependence of the OP
\begin{equation}
	\vert \psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2 = \vert \psi_{0} \vert^2 (1 - \xi(T)^2 q^2)
\end{equation}
For some value, SC order breaks down, \(\psi_{\vb{q}_c} = 0\), because the kinetic energy from phase modulation exceeds the gain in energy from pairing.
In GL theory: \(q_c = \xi(T)^{-1}\).
The temperature dependence of the OP and extracted \(\xi(T)\) gives access to the coherence length via
\begin{equation}
	\xi(T) = \xi_0 (1 - \frac{T}{T_C})^{-\frac{1}{2}}

\section{Bardeen-Coooper-Schrieffer Theory}\label{sec:bcs-theory}

It took nearly 50 years after the first discovery of superconductivity in mercury by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1911 \cite{onnesFurtherExperimentsLiquid1991} for the first microscopic description of this phenomenon to be published in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and J. Robert Schrieffer \cite{bardeenTheorySuperconductivity1957}.
This \glsxtrfull{bcs} theory is one of the great successes in physics history.

The \glsxtrshort{bcs} description of superconductivity is based on the fact that the Fermi sea is unstable towards development of bound pairs under arbitrarily small attraction \cite{cooperBoundElectronPairs1956}.
The origin of the attractive interaction \(V_{{\vb{k}, \vb{k}^{\prime}}}\), which Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer identified as a retarded electron-phonon interaction \cite{bardeenTheorySuperconductivity1957}.

There exist many textbooks tackling BCS theory from different angles, such as chapter 14 in refs. \cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015, tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity1996}.
This section gives an introduction to the relevant physics of \glsxtrshort{bcs} theory as originally proposed, then derives the

\subsection{BCS Hamiltonian}

\todo{Work over paragraph}

BCS-Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BCS Hamiltonian}
	H_{\text{BCS}} = \sum_{\vb{k}\sigma} \epsilon_{\vb{k}\sigma} c_{\vb{k}\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{\vb{k}\sigma} + \sum_{\vb{k}, \vb{k}^{\prime}} V_{\vb{k}, \vb{k}^{\prime}} c_{\vb{k}\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{-\vb{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{-\vb{k}^{\prime}\downarrow} c_{\vb{k}^{\prime}\uparrow}
\end{equation}
This Hamiltonian can be solved exactly using a mean field approach, because it involves an interaction at zero momentum and thus infinite range.
Order parameter in mean field BCS theory is the pairing amplitude
\begin{equation}
	\Delta = - \frac{U}{N_{\vb{k}}} \sum_{\vb{k}} \braket{c_{-\vb{k} \downarrow} c_{\vb{k} \uparrow}} = - U \braket{c_{-\vb{r}=0 \downarrow} c_{\vb{r=0} \uparrow}} \simeq U \Psi \;.
\end{equation}
More about mean field theory in \cref{ssec:Multiband BCS Mean Field Theory}

A finite \(\Delta\) corresponds to the pairing introduced above: there is a finite expectation value for a coherent creation/annihilation of a pair of electrons with opposite momentum and spin.
A finite \(\Delta\) also introduces a band gap into the spectrum.
BCS theory brings multiple aspects together: concept of paired electrons with the pairing amplitude being the order parameter in SC, an explanation for the attractive interaction overcoming Coulomb repulsion and a model Hamiltonian that very elegantly captures the essential physics.

It is very successful in two ways: on the one hand it could quantitatively predict effects in the SCs known at the time, for example the Hebel-Slichter peak that was measured in 1957 \cite{hebelNuclearRelaxationSuperconducting1957, hebelNuclearSpinRelaxation1959} and the band gap measured by Giaever in 1960 \cite{giaeverStudySuperconductorsElectron1961}.  
On the other hand, it established electronic pairing as the microscopic mechanism behind SC, which holds still today even for high \(T_C\)/unconventional superconductors, so SCs that cannot be described by BCS theory \cite{zhouHightemperatureSuperconductivity2021}.

\todo{Other pairing interactions can be taken, gives explanations for a lot of different SCs}

\subsection{Multiband BCS Mean Field Theory}\label{ssec:Multiband BCS Mean Field Theory}

The Hubbard model is the simplest model for interacting electron systems.
It goes back to works by Hubbard \cite{hubbardElectronCorrelationsNarrow1963}, Kanamori \cite{kanamoriElectronCorrelationFerromagnetism1963} and Gutzweiler \cite{gutzwillerEffectCorrelationFerromagnetism1963}.
\begin{equation}
	H_{\mathrm{int}} = U \sum_{i} c_{i, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \downarrow} c_{i, \uparrow}
\end{equation}
where \(U > 0\).

Besides 

\cite{qinHubbardModelComputational2022}

\todo{Some relevance of the repulsive Hubbard model}

This simple Hubbard model can be extended in a multitude of ways to model a variety of physical system.
In this work: extension to multiple orbitals (i.e. atoms in the unit cell for lattice systems) and an attractive interaction, i.e. a negative \(U\).
Physical motivation for taking a negative-U Hubbard model: electrons can experience a local attraction interaction, for example through electrons coupling with phononic degrees of freedom or with electronic excitations that can be described as bosons \cite{micnasSuperconductivityNarrowbandSystems1990}.
\todo{There are some more specific papers to the specific mechanisms (and also some more mechanism), could cite these here and say some more things}
The form of the interaction term is then: \todo{Order of operators? -> also in all other equations!}
\begin{equation}
	H_{\mathrm{int}} = -\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}
	\label{eq:Hubbard interaction multiband}
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha\) counts orbitals and the minus sign in front is taken so that \(U > 0\) now corresponds to an attractive interaction (this is purely convention).

There are a multitude of ways to derive a mean field description of a given interacting Hamiltonian.
Very rigorous in path integral formulations as saddle points, given for example in ref. \cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015}.
The review follows \cite{huhtinenSuperconductivityNormalState2023}.
A more intuitive way based on ref. \cite{bruusManyBodyQuantumTheory2004} discussed here looks at the operators and which one are small. 

Look at interaction term \cref{eq:Hubbard interaction multiband}.
Mean-field approximation (here specifically for superconductivity i.e. pairing): operators do not deviate much from their average value, i.e. the deviation operators \todo{there are other combinations, talk about that}
\todo{deviations with small deltas}
\begin{align}
	d_{i, \alpha} = c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} - \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \\
	e_{i, \alpha} = c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow} - \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}}
\end{align}
are small (dont contribute much to expectation values and correlation functions), so that in the interaction part of the Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
	H_{\mathrm{int}} &= -\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow} \\

	&= -\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} (

the first term is quadratic in the deviation and can be neglected.
Thus arrive at the approximation

Have different kinds of Green's functions, for example the retarded Green's function (here with the \(k\) for lattice systems):

They give the amplitude of a particle inserted at momentum \(\vb{k}^{\prime}\) at time \(t^{\prime}\) to propagate to position \(\vb{k}\) at time \(t\).
Define Fourier-transform:

Can define the spectral function from this:
\begin{equation}
	A(\vb{k} \sigma, \omega) = -2 \Im G^R (\vb{k} \sigma, \omega)
\end{equation}
Looking at the diagonal elements of \(G^R\) here.
The spectral function can be thought of as the energy resolution of a particle with energy \(\omega\).
This mean, for non-interacting systems, the spectral function is a delta-function around the single-particle energies:
\begin{equation}
	A_0 (\vb{k} \sigma, \omega) = 2\pi \delta (\omega - \epsilon_{\vb{k} \sigma})

For interacting systems this is not true, but \(A\) can still be peaked.

A mathematical trick to calculate GFs in praxis is to introduce the imaginary time variable \(\tau\)
\begin{equation}
	t \to -\iu \tau
\end{equation}
where \(\tau\) is real and has the dimension time.
This enables the simultaneous expansion of exponential \(e^{-\beta H}\) coming from the thermodynamic average and \(e^{-\iu H t}\) coming from the time evolution of operators.
Define Matsubara GF \gls{matsubara correlation function}:
\todo{Introduce Greens functions instead of correlation functions}
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{C}_{A B} (\tau, 0) = - \Braket{T_{\tau} (A(\tau) B(0))}
\end{equation}
with time-ordering operator in imaginary time:
\begin{equation}
	T_{\tau} (A(\tau) B(\tau^{\prime})) = \Theta(\tau - \tau^{\prime}) A(\tau) B(\tau^{\prime}) \pm \Theta(\tau^{\prime} - \tau) B(\tau^{\prime}) A(\tau)
\end{equation}
so that operators with later `times' go to the left.

Can prove from properties of Matsubara GF, that they are only defined for
\begin{equation}
	-\beta < \tau < \beta
\end{equation}
Due to this, the Fourier transform of the Matsubara GF is defined on discrete values:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{C}_{A B} (\iu \omega_n) = \int_{0}^{\beta} \odif{\tau}
\end{equation}
with fermionic/bosonic Matsubara frequencies
\begin{equation}
	\omega_n =
	\begin{cases}
		\frac{2n \pi}{\beta} \, \text{for bosons} \\
		\frac{(2n + 1)\pi}{\beta} \, \text{for fermions}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}

It turns out that Matsubara GFs and retarded GFs can be generated from a common function \(\mathcal{C}_{AB} (z)\) that is defined on the entire complex plane except for the real axis.
So we can get the retarded GF \(\mathcal{C}_{AB}^R (\omega)\) by analytic continuation:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{C}_{AB}^R (\omega) = \mathcal{C}_{AB} (\iu \omega_n \to \omega + \iu \eta)
\end{equation}
\todo{What is the eta there -> need to define it in retarded GF}
So in particular the extrapolation of the Matsubara GF to zero is proportional to the density of states at the chemical potential.
Gapped: density is zero (Matsubara GF goes to 0), metal: density is finite (Matsubara GF goes to finite value).

Following \cite{georgesDynamicalMeanfieldTheory1996}.

Most general non-interacting electronic Hamiltonian in second quantization:
\begin{equation}
	H_0 = \sum_{i, j, \sigma}
\end{equation}
with lattice coordinates \(i, j\) and spin \(\sigma\).

One particle Green's function (many-body object, coming from the Hubbard model):
\begin{equation}
	G(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n) = \frac{1}{\iu \omega_n + \mu - \epsilon_{\vb{k}} - \Sigma(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)}
\end{equation}
with the self energy \(\Sigma(\iu \omega_n)\) coming from the solution of the effect on-site problem:

The Dyson equation
\begin{equation}
	G(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n) = \left( G_0 (\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n) - \Sigma(\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)\right)^{-1}
\end{equation}
relates the non-interacting Greens function \(G_0 (\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)\) and the fully-interacting Greens function \(G (\vb{k}, \iu \omega_n)\) (inversion of a matrix!).
