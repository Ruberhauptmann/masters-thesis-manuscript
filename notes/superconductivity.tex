\chapter{Superconductivity}\label{ch:superconductivity}

Superconductivity is an example of an emergent phenomenon: the SchrÃ¶dinger equation describing all interactions between electrons gives no indication that there exists parameters for which the electrons condense into phase coherent pairs.
In this chapter I review theoretical concepts needed for understanding superconductivity and introduce the tools used to study superconductivity in the later chapters.
There are many textbooks covering these topics which can be referenced for a more detailed treatment, such as refs. \cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015, tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity1996, bruusManyBodyQuantumTheory2004, larkinTheoryFluctuationsSuperconductors2005, bennemannSuperconductivity2008}.

Macroscopically, the superconducting state can be described by a spontaneous breaking of a \(U(1)\) phase rotation symmetry that is associated with an order parameter.
The theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking and associated phase transitions is Ginzburg-Landau theory discussed in \cref{sec:Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity}, following refs. \cite{beekmanIntroductionSpontaneousSymmetry2019, colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015}.
Ginzburg-Landau theory introduces two length scales: the coherence length \(\xi_0\) describing the length scale of amplitude variations of the order parameter and the London penetration depth \(\lambda_L\), which is connected to energy cost of phase variations of the order parameter.
They also connect to the energy gap \(\Delta\) and the condensate stiffness \(D_{\mathrm{S}}\), which are often competing energy scales in superconductors.
The interplay of these length (energy) scales determine the macroscopic properties of a superconductors, so there is a great interest in accessing them in computational ways.
To this end, \cref{sec:Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity} also introduces a theoretical framework based on Cooper pairs with finite momentum \cite{wittBypassingLatticeBCS2024} that will be used in later chapters to calculate these length scales from microscopic theories.

Ginzburg Landau theory is a macroscopic theory, but it can be connected to microscopic theories: if a theory finds an expression for the order parameter describing the breakdown of symmetry, it can be connected to quantities expressed by Ginzburg-Landau theory.
One such theory to describe superconductivity from a microscopic perspective is \glsxtrfull{bcs} theory in \cref{sec:bcs-theory}, which is 
A method to treat local interactions non-perturbatively is \glsxtrfull{dmft}. \Cref{sec:Dynamical Mean-Field Theory} briefly introduces the Greens function method to treat many-body problems and outlines the \glsxtrshort{dmft} self-consistency cycle.

Furthermore, \cref{sec:quantum-metric} introduces an emerging perspective in the study of novel superconductors: it turns out that the superfluid weight is connected to a quantity of the electronic band structure called the quantum metric \cite{peottaSuperfluidityTopologicallyNontrivial2015, yuQuantumGeometryQuantum2024}, which is connected to 

\section{Ginzburg-Landau Theory of Superconductivity}\label{sec:Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity}

\subsection*{Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Order Parameter}

Symmetries are a powerful concept in physics.
Noethers theorem \cite{noetherInvarianteVariationsprobleme1918} connects the symmetries of physical theories to associated conservation laws.
An interesting facet of symmetries in physical theories is the fact, that a ground state of a system must not necessarily obey the same symmetries of its Hamiltonian, i.e. for a symmetry operation that is described by a unitary operator \(U\), the Hamiltonian commutes with \(U\) (which results in expectation values of the Hamiltonian being invariant under the symmetry operation) but the states \(\ket{\phi}\) and \(U \ket{\phi}\) are different.
This phenomenon is called spontaneous symmetry breaking and the state \(\ket{\phi}\) is said to be symmetry-broken.

One consequence of this fact is that for a given symmetry-broken state \(\ket{\phi}\), there exists multiple states that can be reached by repeatedly applying \(U\) to \(\ket{\phi}\) and all have the same energy.
To differentiate the symmetry-broken states an operator can be defined that has all these equivalent states as eigenvectors with different eigenvalues and zero expectation value for symmetric states.
This is the microscopic notion of an order parameter.

The original notion of an order parameter was motivated from macroscopic observables that can then be related to the microscopic order parameter operator introduced above.
Macroscopically I characterize the symmetry breaking by an order parameter \(\Psi\) which generally can be a complex-valued vector that becomes non-zero below the transition temperature \(T_C\)
\begin{equation}
	\vert \Psi \vert =
	\begin{cases}
		0 & T > T_C \\
		\vert \Psi_0 \vert > 0 & T < T_C
	\end{cases} \;.
\end{equation}

In the example of a ferromagnet, a finite magnetization of a material is associated with a finite expectation value for the \(z\)-component of the spin operator, \(m_z = \braket{\ope{S_z}}\).
The order parameter describes the `degree of order` \cite{landauTheoryPhaseTransitions1937}.
Similarly to a magnetically ordered state, the SC state is characterized by an order parameter.
The theory of phase transitions in superconductors was developed by Ginzburg and Landau \cite{ginzburgTheorySuperconductivity1950}.
Landau theory and conversely Ginzburg-Landau theory is not concerned with the the microscopic properties of the order parameter, but describes the changes in thermodynamic properties of matter with the development of an order parameter.
In superconductivity, the order parameter is described by coherent pairs of electrons with opposite momentum and spin.
This will be explained in more detail later, but might be helpful to think of Cooper pairs already when discussing Ginzburg-Landau theory.  

\subsection*{Landau and Ginzburg-Landau Theory}\label{sub:Landau and Ginzburg-Landau Theory}

The free energy is a thermodynamic quantity:
\begin{equation}
	F = E - T S
\end{equation}
with the energy of the system \(E\), temperature \(T\) and entropy \(S\).
A system in thermodynamic equilibrium has minimal free energy.
The fundamental idea underlying Landau theory is to write the free energy \(F[\Psi]\) as function of the order parameter \(\Psi\) and expand it as a polynomial:
\begin{equation}
	F_L[\Psi] = \int \odif[order={d}]{x} f_L [\Psi] \;,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	f_L [\Psi] = \frac{r}{2} \Psi^2 + \frac{u}{4} \Psi^4
\end{equation}
is called the free energy density.
\todo{Do minima first, then redefine r}
Provided the parameters \(r\) and \(u\) are greater than \(0\), there is a minimum of \(f_L [\Psi]\) that lies at \(\Psi = 0\).
Landau theory assumes that at the phase transition temperature \(T_C\) the parameter \(r\) changes sign, so it can be written in first order as
\begin{equation}
	r = a(T - T_C) \;.
\end{equation}

(\subref{sfig:Ginzburg Landau free energy}) Landau free energy for a complex order parameter \(\Psi\).
	} 
	\label{fig:Landau free energy and Ginzburg-Landau free energy}
\end{figure}

\Cref{sfig:Landau free energy} shows the free energy as a function of a single-component, real order parameter \(\Psi\) and it illustrates the essence of Landau theory: there are two cases for the minima of the free energy \(f\)
\begin{equation}
	\Psi = \begin{cases}
		0 & T \geq T_C \\
		\pm \sqrt{\frac{a (T_C - T)}{u}} & T < T_C
	\end{cases} \;,
\end{equation}
so there is a for \(T < T_C\) there are two minima corresponding to ground states with broken symmetry.
When the order parameter can be calculated from some microscopic theory, the critical temperature \(T_C\) can be extracted from the behavior of the order parameter near \(T_C\) via a linear fit of
\begin{equation}
	\vert \Psi \vert^2 \propto T_C - T \;.
\end{equation}

Generalizing this from a one to an \(n\)-component order parameters is straightforward.
One example is the complex or two component order parameter that will become important for superconductivity
\begin{equation}
	\Psi = \Psi_1 + \iu \Psi_2 = \vert \Psi \vert e^{\iu \phi} \,.
\end{equation}
The Landau free energy then takes the form
\begin{equation}
	f_L [\Psi] = r \Psi^* \Psi + \frac{u}{2} (\Psi^* \Psi)^2 = r \vert \Psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \Psi \vert^4
\end{equation}
with again
\begin{equation}
	r = a(T_C - T) \;.
\end{equation}
Instead of the two minima, the free energy here is rotational symmetry, because it is independent of the phase of the order parameter: 
\begin{equation}
	f_L [\Psi] = f_L [e^{\iu \phi} \Psi] \;.
\end{equation}
This gives the so called `Mexican hat' potential shown in \cref{sfig:Ginzburg Landau free energy}.
In this potential, the order parameter can be rotated continuously from one symmetry-broken state to another.

In 1950, Ginzburg and Landau published their theory of superconductivity, based on Landaus theory of phase transitions \cite{ginzburgTheorySuperconductivity1950}.
Where Landau theory as described above has an uniform order parameters, Ginzburg-Landau theory accounts for it being inhomogeneous, so an order parameter with spatially varying amplitude or direction.
This in turn leads to the order parameter developing a fixed phase, which is the underlying mechanism of the superflow in superconductors.

Ginzburg-Landau theory can be developed for a general \(n\)-component order parameter, but in superfluids and superconductors the order parameter is complex, i.e. two-component.
The Ginzburg-Landau free energy for a complex order parameter is
\begin{equation}
	f_{\mathrm{GL}} [\Psi, \adif{\Psi}] = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \vert \adif{\Psi} \vert^2 + r \vert \Psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \Psi \vert^4 \;,
	\label{eq:free energy ginzburg-landau theory}
\end{equation}
where the gradient term \(\adif{\Psi}\) is added in comparison to the Landau free energy.
The prefactor \(\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*}\) is chosen to illustrate the interpretation of the Ginzburg-Landau free energy as the energy of a condensate of bosons, where the gradient term \(\vert \adif{\Psi} \vert^2\) is the kinetic energy.
The free energy in \cref{eq:free energy ginzburg-landau theory} is sensitive to a twist of the phase of the order parameter.
Substituting the expression \(\Psi = \vert \Psi \vert e^{\iu \phi}\), the gradient term reads
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \Psi = (\adif{\vert \Psi \vert} + \iu \adif{\phi} \vert \Psi \vert) e^{\iu \phi} \;.
\end{equation}
With that, \cref{eq:free energy ginzburg-landau theory} becomes
\begin{equation}
	f_{GL}  = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} \vert \Psi \vert^2 (\adif{\phi})^2 + \left[ \frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*} (\adif{\vert \Psi \vert})^2 + r \vert \Psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \Psi \vert^4 \right] \;.
	\label{eq:free energy ginzburg-landau theory with phase}
\end{equation}
Now the contributions of phase and amplitude variations are split up: the first term describes energy cost of variations in the phase of the order parameter and the second term describes energy cost of variations in the magnitude of the order parameter.

The dominating fluctuation is determined by the ratio of the factors \(\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*}\) and \(r\), which has the dimension \(\mathrm{Length}^2\), from which define the correlation length.
\begin{equation}
	\xi = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^* \vert r \vert}} = \xi_0 \left(1 - \frac{T}{T_C}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
	\label{eq:correlation length GL theory}
\end{equation}
where I define the zero temperature value as the coherence length \(\xi_0 = \xi(T=0) = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2 m a T_C}}\).
On length scales above \(\xi\), the physics is entirely controlled by the phase degrees of freedom, i.e.
\begin{align}
	f_{\mathrm{GL}} &= \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m^*} \vert \Psi \vert^2 \left(\adif{\phi}\right)^2 + \mathrm{const.} \\
	&= \frac{\hbar^2}{4 m^*} n_{\mathrm{S}} \left(\adif{\phi}\right)^2 + \mathrm{const.} \\
	&= D_{\mathrm{S}} \left(\adif{\phi}\right)^2 + \mathrm{const.} \label{eq:GL energy above correlation length}
\end{align}
where \(\frac{n_{\mathrm{S}}}{2} = \vert \Psi \vert^2\) is the density of single electrons that form the Cooper pairs, also called the superfluid or superconducting density.
\Cref{eq:GL energy above correlation length} shows that twisting the phase of the condensate is associated with an energy cost.
This energy cost is characterized by the superfluid phase stiffness \(D_{\mathrm{S}}\).


Assuming frozen amplitude fluctuations \(\adif{\vert \Psi (\vb{r}) \vert} = 0\), the stationary point of \cref{eq:free energy ginzburg-landau theory with phase} is
\begin{equation}
	\vert \Psi \vert = \vert \Psi_0 \vert \sqrt{1 - \xi^2 \vert \adif{\phi} (\vb{r}) \vert^2} \;.
	\label{eq:breakdown of OP with phase fluctuations}
\end{equation}
This shows that the superconducting order gets suppressed and eventually destroyed by short-ranged (below \(\xi\)) phase fluctuations.
By introducing a particular form of phase fluctuations \(\phi = \vb{q} \cdot \vb{r}\) into a microscopic model, it is possible to probe this breakdown of superconductivity and thus gain insight into the nature of superconductivity, in particular this gives access to \(\xi\).

The discussion so far is valid for neutral superfluids, but superconductors are charged superfluids, so they couple to electromagnetic fields.
The Ginzburg-Landau free energy with minimal coupling to an electromagnetic field is
\begin{equation}
	f_{\mathrm{GL}} [\Psi, \vb{A}] = \frac{\hbar^2}{2 m^*} \left\vert \left( \Delta - \frac{\iu e^*}{\hbar} \vb{A} \right) \Psi \right\vert^2 + r \vert \Psi \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \Psi \vert^4 + \frac{B^2}{2 \mu_0}
	\label{eq:GL energy with minimal coupling to EM field} \;.
\end{equation}
with an additional term to include the electromagnetic energy of the magnetic field \(\vb{B} = \nabla \times \vb{A}\).
It really describes two intertwined Ginzburg-Landau theories for \(\Psi\) and \(\vb{A}\).
This mean there are two length scales, the coherence length \(\xi\) governing amplitude fluctuations of \(\Psi\) and the London penetration depth \(\lambda_L\) which determines the distance magnetic fields penetrate into the superconductor.

The current density can be calculated from the stationary point condition of the free energy w.r.t. the vector potential \(\vb{A}\)
\begin{equation}
	\fdv{f_{\mathrm{GL}}}{\vb{A}} = -\vb{j} + \frac{1}{\mu_0} \nabla \times \vb{B} \overset{!}{=} 0
\end{equation}
defining the supercurrent density
\begin{equation}
	\vb{j} = -\iu \frac{e\hbar}{m^*} \left(\Psi^* \adif{\Psi} - \Psi \adif{\Psi^*}\right) - \frac{4 e^2}{m^*} \vert \Psi \vert^2 \vb{A} \;.
	\label{eq:supercurrent density GL theory with phase and vector potential}
\end{equation}
Introducing the order parameter with a fixed phase \(\Psi = \vert \Psi \vert e^{\iu \phi}\) gives
\begin{equation}
	\vb{j} = 2 e \vert \Psi \vert^2 \frac{\hbar}{m^*} \left(\nabla \phi - \frac{2 \pi}{\Phi_0} \vb{A} \right)
\end{equation}
with the magnetic flux quantum \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi \hbar}{e}\).
This shows that not only an applied field \(\vb{A}\) can induce a supercurrent, but also the phase twist \(\nabla \phi\) of the condensate ground state, which is the remarkable property of superconductors enabling the dissipationless current.
Where a conventional current is achieved by excitations above the ground state, the superflow is achieved through deformation of the ground-state phase.
The supercurrent can be gauge-transformed to
\begin{equation}
	\vb{j} = -\frac{4e^2 n_S}{m^*} \vb{A} = \tilde{D}_S \vb{A}
\end{equation}
which shows that the superfluid phase stiffness
\begin{equation}
	D_{\mathrm{S}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{(2e)^2} \tilde{D}_S
\end{equation}
also encodes the linear response of a system to a small applied vector field \(\vb{A}\).

\subsection*{Superconducting Length Scales}

As already discussed in the last section, access to the breakdown of the order parameter with phase fluctuations can give information on the coherence length \(\xi\) and the London penetration depth \(\lambda_L\).
This is a method developed by \citeauthor{wittBypassingLatticeBCS2024} for characterizing superconductivity in alkali-doped fullerides, a material with strong electronic correlations.
The authors find that multiorbital effects enable a superconducting state with a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperatures with increasing pairing interaction \cite{wittBypassingLatticeBCS2024}.
Access to the superconducting length scales is especially important in the context of BCS-BEC crossover physics and characterizing new high \(T_C\) superconductors.
This is discussed in \cref{sec:BCS-BEC crossover}.

This section gives an introduction to the method in Ginzburg-Landau theory, the inclusion into microscopic theories like BCS-theory and DMFT will be discussed in the respective sections.

\todo{Work over paragraph}
As already discussed in the context of \cref{eq:breakdown of OP with phase fluctuations}, strong phase fluctuations destroy superconducting order.
A particular choice of phase fluctuations would be
\begin{equation}
	\phi (\vb{r}) = \vb{q} \cdot \vb{r}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to Cooper pairs with a finite momentum \(\vb{q}\).

In most materials: Cooper pairs do not carry finite center-of-mass momentum.
In presence of e.g.\ external fields or magnetism: SC states with FMP might arise \cite{chenFiniteMomentumCooper2018, wanOrbitalFuldeFerrell2023, yuanSupercurrentDiodeEffect2022}

Procedure in the paper: enforce FMP states via constraints on pair-center-of-mass momentum \(\vb{q}\), access characteristic lenght scales \(\xi_0, \lambda_L\) through analysis of the momentum and temperature-dependent OP\@.
FF-type pairing with Cooper pairs carrying finite momentum:
\begin{equation}
	\Psi_{\vb{q}} (\vb{r}) = \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert e^{\iu \vb{q} \vb{r}}
\end{equation}
Then the free energy density \cref{eq:free energy ginzburg-landau theory} is
\begin{equation}
	f_{GL} [\Psi_{\vb{q}}] = r \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2 + \frac{u}{2} \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^4 + \frac{\hbar^2 q^2}{2 m^*} \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2
\end{equation}
Stationary point of the system:
\begin{equation}
	\fdv{f_{GL}}{\Psi_{\vb{q}}^*} = 2 \Psi_{\vb{q}} \left[r (1 - \xi^2 q^2) + u \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2\right] = 0
\end{equation}
which results in the \(\vb{q}\)-dependence of the OP
\begin{equation}
	\vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2 = \vert \Psi_{0} \vert^2 \left(1 - \xi(T)^2 q^2\right)
\end{equation}
For some value, SC order breaks down, \(\psi_{\vb{q}_c} = 0\), because the kinetic energy from phase modulation exceeds the gain in energy from pairing.
In GL theory: \(q_c = \xi(T)^{-1}\).
The temperature dependence of the OP and extracted \(\xi(T)\) gives access to the coherence length via \cref{eq:correlation length GL theory}
\begin{equation}
	\xi(T) = \xi_0 \left(1 - \frac{T}{T_C}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}
\end{equation}
The momentum of the Cooper pairs entails a charge supercurrent \(\vb{j}_{\vb{q}}\).
The current coming from the momentum can be calculated from \cref{eq:supercurrent density GL theory with phase and vector potential} (using \(\phi(\vb{r}) = \vb{q} \cdot \vb{r}\) and \(\vb{A} = 0\)):
\begin{equation}
	\vb{j}_{\vb{q}} = \frac{2 \hbar e}{m^*} \vert \Psi_{\vb{q}} \vert^2 \vb{q}
\end{equation}
The current \(\vb{j}_{\vb{q}}\) is a non-monotonous function of \(\vb{q}\) with a maximum called the depairing current \(j_{dp}\) as can be seen in \cref{sfig:Ginzburg Landau current vs q} \todo{Depairing current connected with correlation length and penetration depth}.

\end{figure}
The depairing current is an upper boundary for the maximal current that can flow through a material, also called the critical current \(\vb{j}_c\).
The value of \(\vb{j}_c\) is strongly dependent on the geometry of the sample \cite{bardeenCriticalFieldsCurrents1962, xuAchievingTheoreticalDepairing2010}, so \(\vb{j}_{dp}\) is not necessarily experimentally available, but it can be used to calculate the London penetration depth \cite{tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity1996}
\begin{equation}
	\lambda_L (T) = \sqrt{\frac{\Phi_0}{3 \sqrt{3} \pi \mu_0 \xi(T) j_{\mathrm{dp}} (T)}} = \lambda_{L,0} \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T}{T_{\mathrm{C}}}\right)^4 \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}} 
\end{equation}
\todo{Where does this formula come from? Second London equation}
The superfluid phase stiffness can then be calculated via
\begin{equation}
	D_S \propto \lambda_L^{-2}
\end{equation}
The finite-momentum method in the limit of \(\vb{q} \to 0\) is related to linear response techniques to calculate the superfluid weight \cite{peottaSuperfluidityTopologicallyNontrivial2015, liangBandGeometryBerry2017}.

\section{Bardeen-Coooper-Schrieffer Theory}\label{sec:bcs-theory}

The \glsxtrfull{bcs} description of superconductivity describes superconductivity as the condensation of electrons into pairs that form a macroscopic quantum state.
There exist many textbooks tackling BCS theory from different angles, such as refs. \cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015, tinkhamIntroductionSuperconductivity1996}.
This section gives an introduction to the relevant physics of \glsxtrshort{bcs} theory as originally proposed, then derives (BCS) mean-field theory for the multiband Hubbard model.

\todo{Better introduction}

\subsection*{BCS Hamiltonian}

\todo{Work over paragraph}

BCS-Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BCS Hamiltonian}
	H_{\text{BCS}} = \sum_{\vb{k}\sigma} \epsilon_{\vb{k}\sigma} c_{\vb{k}\sigma}^{\dagger} c_{\vb{k}\sigma} + \sum_{\vb{k}, \vb{k}^{\prime}} V_{\vb{k}, \vb{k}^{\prime}} c_{\vb{k}\uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{-\vb{k}\downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{-\vb{k}^{\prime}\downarrow} c_{\vb{k}^{\prime}\uparrow}
\end{equation}
This Hamiltonian can be solved exactly using a mean field approach, because it involves an interaction at zero momentum and thus infinite range.
Order parameter in mean field BCS theory is the pairing amplitude
\begin{equation}
	\Delta = - \frac{U}{N_{\vb{k}}} \sum_{\vb{k}} \braket{c_{-\vb{k} \downarrow} c_{\vb{k} \uparrow}} = - U \braket{c_{-\vb{r}=0 \downarrow} c_{\vb{r=0} \uparrow}} \simeq U \Psi \;.
\end{equation}

A finite \(\Delta\) corresponds to the pairing introduced above: there is a finite expectation value for a coherent creation/annihilation of a pair of electrons with opposite momentum and spin.
A finite \(\Delta\) also introduces a band gap into the spectrum.
BCS theory brings multiple aspects together: concept of paired electrons with the pairing amplitude being the order parameter in SC, an explanation for the attractive interaction overcoming Coulomb repulsion and a model Hamiltonian that very elegantly captures the essential physics.
In particular, the model Hamiltonian can be expanded with other types of pairing interactions to give a picture of superconductivity in the cuprates, compare ch. 15 in \cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015}.

BCS theory is very successful in two ways: on the one hand it could quantitatively predict effects in the SCs known at the time, for example the Hebel-Slichter peak that was measured in 1957 \cite{hebelNuclearRelaxationSuperconducting1957, hebelNuclearSpinRelaxation1959} and the band gap measured by Giaever in 1960 \cite{giaeverStudySuperconductorsElectron1961}.  
On the other hand, it established electronic pairing, i.e. the picture of a quantum-mechanical wave function with a defined phase as already described by Fritz London in 1937 \cite{londonNewConceptionSupraconductivity1937} as the microscopic mechanism behind SC.
This picture still holds today even for high \(T_C\)/unconventional superconductors, so SCs that cannot be described by BCS theory \cite{zhouHightemperatureSuperconductivity2021}.

\subsection*{Multiband BCS Theory}

\todo{Write chemical potential properly}
The Hubbard model is the simplest model for interacting electron systems.
It goes back to works by Hubbard \cite{hubbardElectronCorrelationsNarrow1963}, Kanamori \cite{kanamoriElectronCorrelationFerromagnetism1963} and Gutzweiler \cite{gutzwillerEffectCorrelationFerromagnetism1963} in the 1960s.
The Hamiltonian of the  single-band Hubbard model is
\begin{equation}
	H = H_0 + H_{\mathrm{int}} 
	= \sum_{\langle i j \rangle \sigma} \left(-t_{i, j} - \mu_{\sigma} \delta_{i, j}\right) c_{i, \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j, \sigma} + \mathrm{h.c.} + U \sum_{i} c_{i, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \downarrow} c_{i, \uparrow}
	\label{eq:Hubbard interaction repulsive}
\end{equation}
where \(U > 0\).
The interaction describes a repulsive interaction between electrons of different spin at the same lattice site.

The Hubbard model emphasizes the electronic correlations due to local interactions, but with the discovery of high \(T_C\) SC in the Cuprates, it was quickly realized that the 2D Hubbard model in the intermediate to strong-coupling regime could describe the \ce{CuO2} layers \cite{zhangEffectiveHamiltonianSuperconducting1988} well.
The Hubbard model has parameter regimes with i.e. \(d_{x^2 - y^2}\) superconductivity, strong antiferromagnetic correlations, stripes, pseudogaps, Fermi liquid, and bad metallic behavior, with the phase diagram lines and observables being similar as a function of doping and temperature. 
Besides the relevancy of the Hubbard model for the Cuprates, the character of the model as having few parameters and simultaneously a very rich phase diagram with a variety of many-body effects also made it a perfect playground for new numerical tools, among them diagonalization, diagrammatics, tensor network, Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods and DMFT (see \cref{sec:Dynamical Mean-Field Theory}) \cite{qinHubbardModelComputational2022}.

The Hubbard model  in the form of \cref{eq:Hubbard interaction repulsive} can be extended in a multitude of ways to model a variety of physical system.
Here: extension to multiple orbitals (i.e. atoms in the unit cell for lattice systems) and an attractive interaction, i.e. a negative \(U\).
Physical motivation for taking a negative-U Hubbard model: electrons can experience a local attraction interaction, for example through electrons coupling with phononic degrees of freedom or with electronic excitations \cite{micnasSuperconductivityNarrowbandSystems1990}.
The form of the interaction term is then:
\begin{equation}
	H_{\mathrm{int}} = -\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}
	\label{eq:Hubbard interaction multiband}
\end{equation}
where \(\alpha\) counts orbitals and the minus sign in front is taken so that \(U > 0\) now corresponds to an attractive interaction (this is purely convention).

There are a multitude of ways to derive a mean field description of a given interacting Hamiltonian.
Very rigorous in path integral formulations as saddle points, given for example in ref. \cite{colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015}.
The review follows ref. \cite{huhtinenSuperconductivityNormalState2023}.
A more intuitive way based on ref. \cite{bruusManyBodyQuantumTheory2004} discussed here looks at the operators and which one are small. 

Look at interaction term \cref{eq:Hubbard interaction multiband}.
Mean-field approximation: operators \(A\) do not deviate much from their average value \(\braket{A}\), i.e. the deviation \(\fdif{A} = A - \braket{A}\) are small.
Specifically for superconductivity i.e. pairing, the operators
\begin{align}
	d_{i, \alpha} = c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} - \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \\
	e_{i, \alpha} = c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow} - \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}}
\end{align}
are small (dont contribute much to expectation values and correlation functions).
So that in the interaction part of the Hamiltonian
\begin{align}
	H_{\mathrm{int}} = &-\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow} \\
	= &-\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} 
	\left( d_{i, \alpha}^{\dagger} + \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \right)
	\left( e_{i, \alpha} + \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}} \right) \\
	= &-\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} (
		d_{i, \alpha} e_{i, \alpha}
		+ d_{i, \alpha} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}} \nonumber \\
		&+ e_{i, \alpha} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}}
		+ \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}})
\end{align}
the first term is quadratic in the deviation and can be neglected.
Thus arrive at the approximation
\begin{align}
	H_{\mathrm{int}} \approx &-\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} \left(
	d_{i, \alpha} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}}
	+ e_{i, \alpha} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \right. \nonumber \\
	&\left.+ \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}}
	\right) \\
	= &-\sum_{i, \alpha} U_{\alpha} \left(
		c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}}
		+ c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \right. \nonumber \\
	&\left.- \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger}} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}} \right) \\
	= &\sum_{i, \alpha} \left(\Delta_{i, \alpha} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow}^{\dagger} + \Delta_{i, \alpha}^{*} c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow} - \frac{\vert \Delta_{i, \alpha} \vert^2}{U_{\alpha}}\right)
\end{align}
with the expectation value
\begin{align}
	\Delta_{i, \alpha} = -U_{\alpha} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}}
\end{align}
which is called the superconducting gap and is the order parameter introduced in Ginzburg-Landau theory in \cref{sec:Ginzburg-Landau theory of superconductivity}.
This results in the mean-field Hamiltonian \todo{MF Hamiltonian, with chemical potential}
\begin{equation}
	H_{\mathrm{MF}} = \sum_{\langle i j \rangle \sigma} \left(-t_{i, j} - \mu_{\sigma} \delta_{i, j}\right) c_{i, \sigma}^{\dagger} c_{j, \sigma} + \mathrm{h.c.} + U \sum_{i} c_{i, \uparrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \downarrow}^{\dagger} c_{i, \downarrow} c_{i, \uparrow}
\end{equation}

To include finite momentum in BCS theory, take the ansatz of a Fulde-Ferrel (FF) type pairing \cite{kinnunenFuldeFerrellLarkin2018}:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta_{i, \alpha} = \Delta_{\alpha} e^{\iu \vb{q} \vb{r}_{i \alpha}}
\end{equation}
Using the Fourier transform (with position vectors \(\vb{r}_{i \alpha} = \vb{R}_i + \delta_{\alpha}\), position of the unit cell \(\vb{R}_i\) and position of the orbital inside the unit cell \(\vb{\delta}_{\alpha}\))
\begin{equation}
	c_{i \alpha \sigma} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{\vb{k}} e^{\iu \vb{k} \vb{r}_{i \alpha}} c_{\vb{k} \alpha \sigma}
\end{equation}
can write mean-field Hamiltonian as
\begin{align}
	H_{\mathrm{MF}} (\vb{q}) &= \sum_{\vb{k}} \vb{C}_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}}^{\dagger} H_{\mathrm{BdG}} (\vb{q}, \vb{k}) \vb{C}_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} + K_{\vb{q}} \\
	C_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} &= 
		\begin{pmatrix}
			c_{\vb{k} 1 \uparrow} & 
			c_{\vb{k} 2 \uparrow} &
			\ldots &
			c_{\vb{k} n_{\mathrm{orb}} \uparrow} &
			c_{\vb{q} -\vb{k} 1 \downarrow}^{\dagger} &
			c_{\vb{q} -\vb{k} 2 \downarrow}^{\dagger} &
			\ldots &
			c_{\vb{q} -\vb{k} n_{\mathrm{orb}} \downarrow}^{\dagger}
		\end{pmatrix}^{T} \\
		K_{\vb{q}} &= \sum_{\vb{k}} \Tr [H_{\vb{k}}^{\downarrow}] - n_{\mathrm{orb}} N \mu - N \sum_{\alpha} \frac{\vert \Delta_{\alpha} (\vb{q}) \vert^2}{U}
\end{align}
with the so-called \acrfull{bdg} matrix
\begin{equation}
	H_{\mathrm{BdG}} (\vb{k}) =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		H^{\uparrow}_{\vb{q} + \vb{k}} - \mu & \Delta (\vb{q}) \\
		\Delta^{\dagger} (\vb{q}) & - \left(H^{\downarrow}_{\vb{q} - \vb{k}}\right)^* + \mu
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with \(H_{0, \sigma}\) being the F.T. of the kinetic term \todo{F.T. of kinetic term} and
\begin{equation}
	\Delta = \diag(\Delta_1 (\vb{q}), \Delta_2 (\vb{q}), \ldots, \Delta_{n_{\mathrm{orb}}} (\vb{q}))\;.
\end{equation}
For time-reversal symmetric systems, there exists a solution s.t. all \(\Delta_{\alpha}\) are real \cite{peottaSuperfluidityTopologicallyNontrivial2015}.
The introduction of the \(\vb{q}\) breaks time-reversal symmetry, s.t. in a multiband system, the order parameters in the orbital can develop different phases.

Problem is  now reduced to diagonalization of the \acrshort{bdg} matrix.
Write
\begin{equation}
	H_{\mathrm{BdG}} = U_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} \epsilon_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} U_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}}^{\dagger}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
	H_{\mathrm{MF}} = \sum_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} \gamma_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} \epsilon_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} \gamma_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}}^{\dagger}
\end{equation}
with quasi-particle operators
\begin{equation}
	\gamma_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}} = U_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}}^{\dagger} C_{\vb{q}, \vb{k}}
\end{equation}

\todo{Write indeces everywhere without comma}

Using the gap equation
\todo{gap equation}
\begin{align}
	\Delta_{\alpha} &= -U_{\alpha} \braket{c_{i, \alpha, \downarrow} c_{i, \alpha, \uparrow}} = -\frac{U}{N} \sum_{\vb{k}} \braket{c_{\vb{q}+\vb{k}}} \nonumber \\
	&= -\frac{U}{N} \\
	&= -\frac{U}{N} \nonumber
\end{align}
the order parameter can be determined self-consistently, i.e. starting from an initial value, the BdG matrix needs to be set up, diagonalized and then used to determine \(\Delta_{\alpha}\) again, until a converged value is found.

\section{The BCS-BEC Crossover}\label{sec:BCS-BEC crossover}

One of the challenges in achieving high-temperature superconductivity is the fact that the two intrinsic energy scales of superconductors i.e. the pairing amplitude and the phase coherence often compete.
Can be seen in the phenomenon of BCS-BEC crossover physics \cite{chenWhenSuperconductivityCrosses2024}.
The picture of this crossover is the following: for a small attractive interaction, pairs of electrons are very loosely bound and mobile, while for a stronger interaction the pairs are bound together stronger and are not mobile, because hopping of a pair would involve a virtual hopping, thus breaking up the pair.
This is highly suppressed.
The crossover region between these two regimes is the BCS-BEC crossover.
The energy scales characterizing the crossover are the superconducting gap/order parameter describing how strong the order is and the superfluid weight describing how mobile the Cooper pairs are.
These two energy scales are equivalently defined via the coherence length \(\xi_0\) and the London penetration depth introduced in \cref{sub:Landau and Ginzburg-Landau Theory}.

Additionally, I will also briefly describe how to describe the superconducting state in terms of Green's function and the consequences for a DMFT implementation.
I will not fully derive the equations of DMFT here, for a more (pedagogical) introduction see refs. \cite{pavariniDynamicalMeanfieldTheory2022, georgesDynamicalMeanfieldTheory1996, colemanIntroductionManyBodyPhysics2015, bruusManyBodyQuantumTheory2004}.

\subsection*{Green's Function Formalism}

Green's functions: method to encode influence of many-body effects on propagation of particles in a system.
Depending on the context, different kinds of Green's functions are employed.
For exampple, Matsubara Green's functions naturally includes finite temperatures.
This is done via a so-called Wick rotation of the time variable \(t\) into imaginary time
\begin{equation}
	t \to -\iu \tau
\end{equation}
where \(\tau\) is real and has the dimension time.
This enables the simultaneous expansion of exponential \(e^{-\beta H}\) coming from the thermodynamic average and \(e^{-\iu H t}\) coming from the time evolution of operators.

Matsubara Greens function are defined as
\begin{equation}
	G_{\alpha_1 \alpha_2} (\tau_1, \tau_2) = - \Braket{T_{\tau} (c_{\alpha_1}(\tau_1) c^{\dagger}_{\alpha_2} (\tau_2))}
\end{equation}
with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \(c_{\alpha}, c^{\dagger}_{\alpha}\) fermionic creation/annihilation operators of quantum states \(\alpha\) in the Heisenberg time-evolution picture \(\ope{A} (\tau) = e^{\tau H} \ope{A} e^{-\tau H}\)
	\item \(\braket{\cdot} = \Tr(\ope{rho} \cdot)\) the thermal expectation value with statistical operator \(\ope{\rho} = \nicefrac{e^{-\beta H}}{Z}\) with partition function \(Z\) and Hamiltonian \(H\)
	\item Time-ordering operator
	\begin{align}
		T_{\tau} (A(\tau) B(\tau^{\prime})) &= \Theta(\tau - \tau^{\prime}) A(\tau) B(\tau^{\prime}) \pm \Theta(\tau^{\prime} - \tau) B(\tau^{\prime}) A(\tau) \\
		&= \begin{cases}
			A (\tau) B(\tau^{\prime}) & \text{if } \tau < \tau^{\prime} \\
			B(\tau^{\prime}) A (\tau) & \text{if } \tau^{\prime} < \tau
		\end{cases}
	\end{align}
\end{itemize}
Thermal equilibrium: Green's function only depends on time differences \(\tau_1 - \tau_2\), so can work with a single time \(\tau = \tau_1 - \tau_2\), shifting \(\tau_2 = 0\).
Fermionic Matsubara Green's functions are antiperiodic in time with periodicity \(\beta\). For \(-\beta < 0 < 0\), cyclic properties of trace tells:
\begin{equation}
	G (\tau) = - G (\tau + \beta)
\end{equation}
Restrict to interval \(0 < \tau < \beta\).
This means that there is a Fourier expansion with discrete frequencies \(\omega_n = \nicefrac{(2n + 1)\pi}{\beta}\):
\begin{equation}
	G (\iu \omega_n) = \int_{0}^{\beta} \odif{\tau} G (\tau) e^{\iu \omega_n \tau}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	G (\tau) = \frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{n} G(\iu \omega_n) e^{-\iu \omega_n \tau}
\end{equation}

Spatial dependence \(\alpha = \vb{R}\).
In lattice context (translationally invariant, \(G\) only depends on \(\vb{R}_1 - \vb{R}_2\)), can transform between real-space and crystal momentum representation as 
\begin{equation}
	G (\vb{k}, \tau) = \sum_i G(\vb{R}_1) e^{\iu \vb{k} \vb{R}_j}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	G(\vb{r}) = \frac{1}{N_{\vb{k}}} \sum_{\vb{k}} G(\vb{k}) e^{-\iu \vb{k} \vb{r}}
\end{equation}

\todo{Connection to experimental observables}
Can get the retarded GF \(G_{AB}^R (\omega)\) by analytic continuation:
\begin{equation}
	G_{AB}^R (\omega) = G_{AB} (\iu \omega_n \to \omega + \iu \eta)
\end{equation}

\section{Quantum Metric}\label{sec:quantum-metric}

Topic in quantum materials: quantum geometry and its influence on a many (quantum) material properties \cite{yuQuantumGeometryQuantum2024}.
First (?) example: the Integer quantum Hall effect \cite{klitzingNewMethodHighAccuracy1980} that was explained by \citeauthor{thoulessQuantizedHallConductance1982} to be a consequence of the unique topology of the ground state of the electron \cite{thoulessQuantizedHallConductance1982}.

Concept of quantum geometry first formulated in 1980 by Provost and Vallee \cite{provostRiemannianStructureManifolds1980}.

Parameter dependent Hamiltonian \(\{H(\lambda)\}\), smooth dependence on parameter \(\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \ldots) \in \mathcal{M}\) (base manifold)

Hamiltonian acts on parametrized Hilbert space \(\mathcal{H} (\lambda)\)

Eigenenergies \(E_n (\lambda)\), eigenstates \(\ket{\phi_n (\lambda)}\)

System state \(\ket{\psi (\lambda)}\) is linear combination of \(\ket{\psi_n (\lambda)}\) at every point in \(\mathcal{M}\)

Infinitesimal variation of the parameter \(\odif{\lambda}\) \todo{Dont get it here}:
\begin{equation}
	\odif{s^2} = \vert\vert \psi (\lambda + \odif{\lambda}) - \si (\lambda) \vert \vert^2 = \braket{\fdif{\psi} | \fdif{\psi}} = \braket{\pdif{\mu} \psi | \pdif{\nu} \psi} \odif{\lambda^{\mu}} \odif{\lambda^{\nu}} = (\gamma_{\mu \nu} + \iu \sigma_{\mu \nu}) \odif{\lambda^{\mu}} \odif{\lambda^{\nu}}
\end{equation}
Last part is splitting up into real and imaginary part

Recently, the Quantum Geometric Tensor (and in turn the quantum metric) was measured \cite{kangMeasurementsQuantumGeometric2025}.
