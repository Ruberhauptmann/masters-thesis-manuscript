\section*{Conventions}
Throughout the text of this thesis scalars are written in italic \(s\), vectors in bold italic \(\vec{s}\) and matrices in bold \(\mat{M}\) fonts.
A matrix element is denoted as \(\left[\mat{M}\right]_{\alpha, \beta}\).
The summation/multiplication over nearest neighbour sites \(i\) and \(j\) is \(\left\langle ij \right\rangle\) as a subscript to \(\sum\)/\(\prod\).
%Furthermore, Hartree atomic units are used in general and only in selected instances it is deviated from this: \(\hbar = m_\mathrm{e} = \mathrm{e} = \nicefrac{4\pi}{\varepsilon_0} = 1\).
