\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I thank my supervisors Prof. Tim Wehling and Prof. Annica Black-Schaffer for the opportunity to work on this fascinating topic.
I had a very enriching time in the summer of 2024 in the `Quantum Matter Theory` group in Uppsala and I want to thank everyone for welcoming me so warmly and giving me an opportunity to get to know all the interesting topics being explored in the group.
I want to especially thank Ankita and Quentin for helping me with all my questions about quantum geometry.

I want to thank everyone in the `Computational Condensed Matter Theory' group in Hamburg for fruitful discussion, a great working environment and help with TRIQS and DMFT.
I thank Niklas Witt for directly helping in understanding many aspects of superconductivity and for proofreading this manuscript.

I owe thanks to all developers of free software, especially the ones I used in this thesis: \LaTeX, \textsc{Python}, \textsc{Numpy}, \textsc{Scipy}, \textsc{Pandas}, \textsc{Matplotlib}, \textsc{Git}.

I thank my family for their continuing support.
I especially thank Liv for all the love and support over the past years.
