I thank my supervisor Professor Tim Wehling for allowing me to get a glimpse into the fascinating research he and his research group do and for the opportunity to learn a lot about condensed matter in the past 5 months.

I also thank Michael Winter and Jan Berges for direct support, scripts, data, \LaTeX\xspace templates and much more as well as the whole group `Computational Condensed Matter Theory' for welcoming me into their open and  productive atmosphere.

I thank all developers of free software, especially the ones I used in this thesis: \LaTeX, \textsc{Python}, \textsc{Numpy}, \textsc{Matplotlib}, \textsc{Git}.

I thank my family for support through my all my studies up until now.

I especially thank Liv for massive amounts of love and support during the writing of this thesis.
