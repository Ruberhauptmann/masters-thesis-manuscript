  abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity---which cannot be explained by weak electron--phonon interactions---in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1{$^\circ$}---the first `magic' angle---the electronic band structure of this `twisted bilayer graphene' exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature--carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

  abstract = {Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the band as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless temperature are calculated within cluster dynamical mean-field theory. We find that while the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are good indicators of superconductivity near zero temperature, at finite temperatures the behavior is more complicated. Our results suggest that the properties of the other bands near the flat band(s) are crucial.},

  abstract = {Topological invariants built from the periodic Bloch functions characterize new phases of matter, such as topological insulators and topological superconductors. The most important topological invariant is the Chern number that explains the quantized conductance of the quantum Hall effect. Here we provide a general result for the superfluid weight Ds of a multiband superconductor that is applicable to topologically nontrivial bands with nonzero Chern number C. We find that the integral over the Brillouin-zone of the quantum metric, an invariant calculated from the Bloch functions, gives the superfluid weight in a flat band, with the bound Ds⩾{\textbar}C{\textbar}. Thus, even a flat band can carry finite superfluid current, provided the Chern number is nonzero. As an example, we provide Ds for the time-reversal invariant attractive Harper--Hubbard model that can be experimentally tested in ultracold gases. In general, our results establish that a topologically nontrivial flat band is a promising concept for increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity has been observed in moir{\'e} systems such as twisted bilayer graphene, which host flat, dispersionless electronic bands. In parallel, theory work has discovered that superconductivity and superfluidity of flat-band systems can be made possible by the quantum geometry and topology of the band structure. These recent key developments are merging into a flourishing research topic: understanding the possible connection and ramifications of quantum geometry on the induced superconductivity and superfluidity in moir{\'e} multilayer and other flat-band systems. This article presents an introduction to how quantum geometry governs superconductivity and superfluidity in platforms including, and beyond, graphene. Ultracold gases are introduced as a complementary platform for quantum geometric effects and a comparison is made to moir{\'e} materials. An outlook sketches the prospects of twisted multilayer systems in providing the route to room-temperature superconductivity.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures - a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we report on an enhancement of superconductivity beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover realized in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A\$\_3\$C\$\_\{60\}\$). We show how strong correlations and multiorbital effects lead into a localized superconducting regime characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. These insights are derived from the development of a theoretical framework to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length (\${\textbackslash}xi\_0\$) and the London penetration depth (\${\textbackslash}lambda\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{L\}\}\$), in microscopic theories and from first principles, even in presence of strong electron correlations.},
