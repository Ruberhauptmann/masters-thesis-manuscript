  abstract = {We show that, quite generally, quantum geometry plays a major role in determining the low-energy physics in strongly correlated lattice models at fractional band fillings. We identify limits in which the Fubini-Study metric dictates the ground states and show that this is highly relevant for Moiré materials leading to symmetry breaking and interaction driven Fermi liquids. This phenomenology stems from a remarkable interplay between the quantum geometry and interaction which is absent in continuum Landau levels but generically present in lattice models where these terms tend to destabilize, e.g., fractional Chern insulators. We explain this as a consequence of the fundamental asymmetry between electrons and holes for band projected normal ordered interactions, as well as from the perspective of a self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculation. These basic insights about the role of the quantum metric, when dominant, turn an extremely strongly coupled problem into an effectively weakly coupled one, and may also serve as a guiding principle for designing material setups. We argue that this is a key ingredient for understanding symmetry-breaking phenomena recently observed in Moiré materials.},

A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏ⁢𝜔. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏ⁢𝜔)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5⁢𝑘⁢𝑇𝑐 at 𝑇=0°K to zero at 𝑇𝑐. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

  abstract = {The behaviour of strongly correlated materials, and in particular unconventional superconductors, has been studied extensively for decades, but is still not well understood. This lack of theoretical understanding has motivated the development of experimental techniques for studying such behaviour, such as using ultracold atom lattices to simulate quantum materials. Here we report the realization of intrinsic unconventional superconductivity—which cannot be explained by weak electron–phonon interactions—in a two-dimensional superlattice created by stacking two sheets of graphene that are twisted relative to each other by a small angle. For twist angles of about 1.1°—the first ‘magic’ angle—the electronic band structure of this ‘twisted bilayer graphene’ exhibits flat bands near zero Fermi energy, resulting in correlated insulating states at half-filling. Upon electrostatic doping of the material away from these correlated insulating states, we observe tunable zero-resistance states with a critical temperature of up to 1.7 kelvin. The temperature–carrier-density phase diagram of twisted bilayer graphene is similar to that of copper oxides (or cuprates), and includes dome-shaped regions that correspond to superconductivity. Moreover, quantum oscillations in the longitudinal resistance of the material indicate the presence of small Fermi surfaces near the correlated insulating states, in analogy with underdoped cuprates. The relatively high superconducting critical temperature of twisted bilayer graphene, given such a small Fermi surface (which corresponds to a carrier density of about 1011 per square centimetre), puts it among the superconductors with the strongest pairing strength between electrons. Twisted bilayer graphene is a precisely tunable, purely carbon-based, two-dimensional superconductor. It is therefore an ideal material for investigations of strongly correlated phenomena, which could lead to insights into the physics of high-critical-temperature superconductors and quantum spin liquids.},

One form of unconventional superconductivity arises when Cooper pairs subjected to a magnetic exchange coupling acquire a finite momentum. Here, we report on a signature of finite momentum Cooper pairing in the three-dimensional topological insulator Bi2Se3. We apply in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields to proximity-coupled Bi2Se3 and find that the in-plane field creates a spatially oscillating superconducting order parameter in the junction as evidenced by the emergence of an anomalous Fraunhofer pattern. We describe how the anomalous Fraunhofer patterns evolve for different device parameters, and we use this to understand the microscopic origin of the oscillating order parameter. The agreement between the experimental data and simulations shows that the finite momentum pairing originates from the coexistence of the Zeeman effect and Aharonov–Bohm flux.},

  abstract = {New developments in superconductivity, particularly through unexpected and often surprising forms of superconducting materials, continue to excite the community and stimulate theory. It is now becoming clear that there are two distinct platforms for superconductivity: natural and synthetic materials. The study of these artificial materials has greatly expanded in the past decade or so, with the discoveries of new forms of superfluidity in artificial heterostructures and the exploitation of proximitization. Natural superconductors continue to surprise through Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides, and nickelates as well as others. This review presents a two-pronged investigation into such superconductors, with an emphasis on those that have come to be understood to belong somewhere between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regimes. The nature of this “crossover” superconductivity, which is to be distinguished from crossover superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases, is a focus here. Multiple ways of promoting a system out of the BCS and into the BCS-BEC crossover regime are addressed in the context of concrete experimental realizations. These involve natural materials, such as organic conductors, as well as artificial, mostly two-dimensional materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene, or gate-controlled devices, as well as one-layer and interfacial superconducting films. Such developments should be viewed as a celebration of BCS theory, as it is now clear that, even though this theory was initially implemented with the special case of weak correlations in mind, it can be extended in a natural way to treat the case of these more exotic strongly correlated superconductors.},

  abstract = {THE superconducting state of a metal is characterized by a complex order parameter with an amplitude and a phase. In the BCS-Eliashberg mean-field theory1, which is a very good approximation for conventional metals, the phase of the order parameter is un-important for determining the value of the transition temperature Tc and the change of many physical properties brought about by the transition. Here we argue that superconductors with low super-conducting carrier density (such as the organic and high-Tc oxide superconductors) are characterized by a relatively small phase 'stiffness9 and poor screening, both of which imply a significantly larger role for phase fluctuations. As a consequence, in these mat-erials the transition to the superconducting state may not display typical mean-field behaviour, and phase fluctuations, both classical and quantum, may have a significant influence on low-temperature properties. For some quasi-two-dimensional materials, notably underdoped high-temperature superconductors, the onset of long-range phase order controls the gross value of Tc as well as its systematic variation from one material to another.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed.

This results in the stabilization of Sn-\$\textbackslash sqrt\{3\}\$ superlattice structures at the interface, which reveal Mott-Hubbard bands, in excellent agreement with both experimental observations and theoretical predictions.

From these changes in the current voltage characteristics, the change in the electron density of states when a metal goes from its normal to its superconductive state can be inferred.

In many novel superconductors phase fluctuations determine 𝑇𝑐, rather than the collapse of the pairing amplitude. We derive rigorous upper bounds on the superfluid phase stiffness for multiband systems, valid in any dimension. This in turn leads to an upper bound on 𝑇𝑐 in two dimensions, which holds irrespective of pairing mechanism, interaction strength, or order-parameter symmetry. Our bound is particularly useful for the strongly correlated regime of low-density and narrow-band systems, where mean-field theory fails. For a simple parabolic band in 2D with Fermi energy 𝐸𝐹, we find that 𝑘𝐵⁢𝑇𝑐 ≤𝐸𝐹/8, an exact result that has direct implications for the 2D BCS-BEC crossover in ultracold Fermi gases. Applying our multiband bound to magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, we find that band structure results constrain the maximum 𝑇𝑐 to be close to the experimentally observed value. Finally, we discuss the question of deriving rigorous upper bounds on 𝑇𝑐 in 3D.},

  abstract = {Bloch bands with a constant dispersion, called flat bands, have attracted great recent interest. Due to the lack of kinetic energy, even small interactions are dominant, and the formation of exotic correlated phases can be favored. Flat bands are particularly promising for superconductivity, where Bardeen-Cooper Schrieffer theory predicts that the superconducting critical temperature can be greatly enhanced compared to a dispersive band. In this dissertation, we explore the properties of flat band models in the attractive Hubbard model, with particular focus on the superconducting phase and the normal state at temperatures above the superconducting transition. The first part presents the theoretical background on superconductivity in multiband Hubbard models, including a linear response computation of the mean-field superfluid weight. In the second part, we explore the role of quantum geometry in flat band superconductivity. In the third part, we discuss the normal state in flat band models, which differs from a usual Fermi liquid. This thesis consists of four publications. In publication II, we showed that the superfluid weight in isolated flat bands is related to the minimal quantum metric, which is the integrated quantum metric with the smallest possible trace. Furthermore, by studying models with dispersive bands touching the flat bands, we showed that such band touchings can be beneficial for superconductivity. In publication III, the many-body problem was solved beyond the mean-field level in isolated flat bands models fulfilling the uniform pairing condition. This study showed that the quadratic excitation of the Cooper pair bound states is determined by the minimal quantum metric. In publication IV, we considered the relationship between quantum geometry and the real part of the optical conductivity in non-interacting flat bands. While the conductivity at non-zero inelastic scattering rate is related to the components of the quantum metric, the DC conductivity vanishes at low enough temperatures due to the localization of the particles. We also showed that a connection to the quantum metric could appear when applying the Kubo-Streda formula at exactly zero temperature in systems with (partially) flat bands, but this effect was absent when evaluating the conductivity using the Kubo-Greenwood formula. In publication I, we studied the normal state properties in the Lieb lattice flat band using dynamical mean field theory. The normal state was found to exhibit a crossover between two different types of non-Fermi liquids. At intermediate interaction strengths, a pseudogap phase with preformed pairs was found. As the interaction was lowered, the state developed insulating characteristics, which could be attributed to the localization of particles.},

  abstract = {The physical description of all materials is rooted in quantum mechanics, which describes how atoms bond and electrons interact at a fundamental level. Although these quantum effects can in many cases be approximated by a classical description at the macroscopic level, in recent years there has been growing interest in material systems where quantum effects remain manifest over a wider range of energy and length scales. Such quantum materials include superconductors, graphene, topological insulators, Weyl semimetals, quantum spin liquids, and spin ices. Many of them derive their properties from reduced dimensionality, in particular from confinement of electrons to two-dimensional sheets. Moreover, they tend to be materials in which electrons cannot be considered as independent particles but interact strongly and give rise to collective excitations known as quasiparticles. In all cases, however, quantum-mechanical effects fundamentally alter properties of the material. This Review surveys the electronic properties of quantum materials through the prism of the electron wavefunction, and examines how its entanglement and topology give rise to a rich variety of quantum states and phases; these are less classically describable than conventional ordered states also driven by quantum mechanics, such as ferromagnetism.},

The comprehensive presentation of the theoretical basis for the FFLO state that we provide is useful also for research on the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity in other physical systems. We focus on settings that have been predicted to be favourable for the FFLO state, such as optical lattices in various dimensions and spin–orbit coupled systems. These are also the most likely systems for near-future experimental observation of the FFLO state. Theoretical bounds, such as Bloch’s and Luttinger’s theorems, and experimentally important limitations, such as finite-size effects and trapping potentials, are considered. In addition, we provide a comprehensive review of the various ideas presented for the observation of the FFLO state. We conclude our review with an analysis of the open questions related to the FFLO state, such as its stability, superfluid density, collective modes and extending the FFLO superfluid concept to new types of lattice systems.},

On the other hand, the superfluid density, which controls the stiffness of the system to phase fluctuations, vanishes as x→0, and increases with increasing x. Optimal Tc is obtained at a crossover from a phase ordering dominated regime at small x to a pairing dominated regime at large x. If this description is valid, then higher Tc's can be obtained in an array of coupled planes with different doped hole concentrations, such that a high pairing scale is derived from the underdoped planes and a large phase stiffness from the optimally or overdoped ones.},

We show how to separate the geometric contribution to the superfluid weight from the conventional one, and that the geometric contribution is associated with the interband matrix elements of the current operator. Our theory can be applied to systems with or without time-reversal symmetry. In both cases the geometric superfluid weight can be related to the quantum metric of the corresponding noninteracting systems. This leads to a lower bound on the superfluid weight given by the absolute value of the Berry curvature. We apply our theory to the attractive Kane-Mele-Hubbard and Haldane-Hubbard models, which can be realized in ultracold atom gases. Quantitative comparisons are made to state of the art dynamical mean-field theory and exact diagonalization results.},

All these phenomena are intimately related to the valley-spin-degenerate and topologically non-trivial flat bands in moiré graphene systems. When time-reversal symmetry is broken spontaneously, such flavour-degenerate topological flat bands exhibit unconventional orbital magnetism associated with real-space current-loop patterns on the moiré length scale. In this Perspective, we first survey key experimental progress on the correlated insulating states and the quantum anomalous Hall phenomena. Most of these phenomena are related to the moiré orbital magnetic states, which originate from the topological nature of the moiré flat bands. Finally, we discuss theoretical progress in the understanding of the correlated insulating and quantum anomalous Hall phenomena from the perspective of spontaneous symmetry breaking.},

It is well known that various metals, when cooled below a certain very low temperature, characteristic of the metal in question, show the strange property of conducting electricity apparently without offering any resistance to the current. This curious phenomenon seems to contradict all our customary conceptions in physics. Particularly striking was the experiment of Kamerlingh Onnes and Tuyn, in which a current was induced in a supraconducting ring of lead and was found to persist there without any measurable decrease for many hours—so long as the low temperature could be maintained. This experiment seems to present a unique case of motion without any friction, whilst we have been accustomed to see in every mechanism an occasion for dissipation of kinetic energy into heat.},

The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or “Boys orbitals” as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

  abstract = {In narrow-band systems electrons can interact with each other via a short-range nonretarded attractive potential. The origin of such an effective local attraction can be polaronic or it can be due to a coupling between electrons and excitons or plasmons. It can also result from purely chemical (electronic) mechanisms, especially in compounds with elements favoring disproportionation of valent states. These mechanisms are discussed and an exhaustive list of materials in which such local electron pairing occurs is given. The authors review the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of such systems in several limiting scenarios: (i) Systems with on-site pairing which can be described by the extended negative-𝑈 Hubbard model. The strong-attraction limit of this model, at which it reduces to a system of tightly bound electron pairs (bipolarons) on a lattice, is extensively discussed. These electron pairs behaving as hard-core charged bosons can exhibit a superconducting state analogous to that of superfluid 4He II. The change-over from weak-attraction BCS-like superconductivity to the superfluidity of charged hard-core bosons is examined. (ii) Systems with intersite pairing described by an extended Hubbard model with 𝑈{$>$}0 and nearest-neighbor attraction and/or nearest-neighbor spin exchange as well as correlated hopping. (iii) A mixture of local pairs and itinerant electrons interacting via a charge-exchange mechanism giving rise to a mutually induced superconductivity in both subsystems. The authors discuss to what extent the picture of local pairing, and in particular superfluidity of hard-core charged bosons on a lattice, can be an explanation for the superconducting and normal-state properties of the high-𝑇𝑐 oxides: doped BaBiO3 and the cuprates.},

The phase diagram, established by simultaneous measurements of resistivity and tunneling spectra under ionic gating, demonstrates a pseudogap phase in the low-doping regime. The ratio of the superconducting transition temperature and Fermi temperature in the low–carrier density limit is consistent with the theoretical upper bound expected in the BCS-BEC crossover regime.

  abstract = {Contemporary quantum materials research is guided by themes of topology and electronic correlations. A confluence of these two themes is engineered in moiré materials, an emerging class of highly tunable, strongly correlated 2D materials designed by the rotational or lattice misalignment of atomically thin crystals. In moiré materials, dominant Coulomb interactions among electrons give rise to collective electronic phases, often with robust topological properties. Identifying the mechanisms responsible for these exotic phases is fundamental to our understanding of strongly interacting quantum systems and to our ability to engineer new material properties for potential future technological applications. In this Review, we highlight the contributions of local spectroscopic, thermodynamic and electromagnetic probes to the budding field of moiré materials research. These techniques have not only identified many of the underlying mechanisms of the correlated insulators, generalized Wigner crystals, unconventional superconductors, moiré ferroelectrics and topological orbital ferromagnets found in moiré materials, but have~also uncovered fragile quantum phases that have evaded spatially averaged global probes. Furthermore, we highlight recently developed local probe techniques, including local charge sensing and quantum interference probes, that have uncovered new physical observables in moiré materials.},

  abstract = {Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the bands as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory. We find that for isolated flat bands, the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are in general good indicators of superconductivity even at finite temperatures. For non-isolated flat bands, a good guideline of the BKT temperature is provided by the zero-temperature superfluid weight and the flat-band ratio.},

The most important topological invariant is the Chern number that explains the quantized conductance of the quantum Hall effect. Here we provide a general result for the superfluid weight Ds of a multiband superconductor that is applicable to topologically nontrivial bands with nonzero Chern number C. We find that the integral over the Brillouin-zone of the quantum metric, an invariant calculated from the Bloch functions, gives the superfluid weight in a flat band, with the bound Ds⩾|C|. Thus, even a flat band can carry finite superfluid current, provided the Chern number is nonzero. As an example, we provide Ds for the time-reversal invariant attractive Harper–Hubbard model that can be experimentally tested in ultracold gases. In general, our results establish that a topologically nontrivial flat band is a promising concept for increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition.},

The physical meaning of such Riemannian structures (which have been recently introduced to describe collective manifolds in nuclear physics) is discussed.

  abstract = {The physics of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) is a topic of keen interest in moiré systems research, and it may provide an insight into the pairing mechanism of other strongly correlated materials such as high-critical-temperature superconductors. Here we use d.c. transport and microwave circuit quantum electrodynamics to directly measure the superfluid stiffness of superconducting MATBG through its kinetic inductance. We find the superfluid stiffness to be much larger than expected from conventional Fermi liquid theory. Rather, it is comparable to theoretical predictions1 and recent experimental indications2 of quantum geometric effects that are dominant at the magic angle. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness follows a power law, which contraindicates an isotropic Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) model. Instead, the extracted power-law exponents indicate an anisotropic superconducting gap, whether interpreted in the Fermi liquid framework or by considering the quantum geometry of flat-band superconductivity. Moreover, a quadratic dependence of the superfluid stiffness on both d.c. and microwave current is observed, which is consistent with the Ginzburg–Landau theory. Taken together, our findings show that MATBG is an unconventional superconductor with an anisotropic gap and strongly suggest a connection between quantum geometry, superfluid stiffness and unconventional superconductivity in MATBG. The combined d.c.–microwave measurement platform used here is applicable to the investigation of other atomically thin superconductors.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity has been observed in moiré systems such as twisted bilayer graphene, which host flat, dispersionless electronic bands. In parallel, theory work has discovered that superconductivity and superfluidity of flat-band systems can be made possible by the quantum geometry and topology of the band structure. These recent key developments are merging into a flourishing research topic: understanding the possible connection and ramifications of quantum geometry on the induced superconductivity and superfluidity in moiré multilayer and other flat-band systems. This article presents an introduction to how quantum geometry governs superconductivity and superfluidity in platforms including, and beyond, graphene. Ultracold gases are introduced as a complementary platform for quantum geometric effects and a comparison is made to moiré materials. An outlook sketches the prospects of twisted multilayer systems in providing the route to room-temperature superconductivity.},

  abstract = {High- cuprate, alkali-doped , and several other unconventional superconductors have very high transition temperatures with respect to the energy scale of superconducting (SC) charges inferred from the superfluid density (SFD). The observed linear relationship between and the SFD can hardly be expected in BCS superconductors while being reminiscent of Bose-Einstein condensation of preformed bosonic charges. As additional non-BCS-like behaviors, responses similar to those in the bulk SC states have been observed at temperatures well above in the vortexlike Nernst effect, diamagnetic susceptibility, and transient optical conductivity in recent photoexcited pump-probe measurements. In this paper, we propose a coherent picture based on equilibrium and transient SFD to understand these unconventional behaviors in cuprates, , and organic superconductors. This picture assumes: (1) Dynamic SC responses in the Nernst and photoinduced measurements emerge at the formation of the local phase coherence (LPC) among wave functions of preformed bosonic pairs. (2) Its onset temperature is distinct from and lower than the boson formation temperature often denoted as the “pseudogap temperature” , as is determined by the many-body boson density while represents attractive interaction between two fermions. (3) The bulk superconducting , signaling global phase coherence, is significantly reduced from , due to the competition between the SC and antiferromagnetic (AF) order. (4) The inelastic magnetic resonance mode (MRM) controls 𝑇c in the SC-AF competition. (5) The transient optical responses can be attributed to a change of the balance between the competing SC and AF orders caused by photoexcitation. The assumptions (1) and (2) explain the relationship between 𝑇c and the transient SFD in photoexcited studies and equilibrium SFD in Nernst effect. (3) and (4) are inferred from the linear dependence of 𝑇c on the MRM energy. (4) and (5) are consistent with the behaviors of the 400⁢−c⁢m−1 optical responses in equilibrium and photoexcited studies and temperature dependence of the intensity of this optical mode and the MRM. Unlike previous phase-fluctuation pictures which expect dynamic responses between 𝑇* and 𝑇c, the present picture involving competing order indicates that dynamic SC responses are seen between 𝑇LPC and 𝑇c.},

  abstract = {In superconductors possessing both time and inversion symmetries, the Zeeman effect of an external magnetic field can break the time-reversal symmetry, forming a conventional Fulde–Ferrell–Larkin–Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state characterized by Cooper pairings with finite momentum1,2. In superconductors lacking (local)~inversion symmetry, the Zeeman effect may still act as the underlying mechanism of FFLO states by interacting with spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Specifically, the interplay between the Zeeman effect and Rashba SOC can lead to the formation of more accessible Rashba FFLO states that cover broader regions in the phase diagram3–5. However, when the Zeeman effect is suppressed because of spin locking in the presence of Ising-type SOC, the conventional FFLO scenarios are no longer effective. Instead, an unconventional FFLO state is formed by coupling the orbital effect of magnetic fields with SOC, providing an alternative mechanism in superconductors with broken inversion symmetries6–8. Here we report the discovery of such an orbital FFLO state in the multilayer Ising superconductor 2H-NbSe2. Transport measurements show that the translational and rotational symmetries are broken in the orbital FFLO state, providing the hallmark signatures of finite-momentum Cooper pairings. We establish the entire orbital FFLO phase diagram, consisting of a normal metal, a uniform Ising superconducting phase and a six-fold orbital FFLO state. This study highlights an alternative route to achieving finite-momentum superconductivity and provides a universal mechanism to preparing orbital FFLO states in similar materials with broken inversion symmetries.},

  abstract = {A wide range of materials, like d-wave superconductors, graphene, and topological insulators, share a fundamental similarity: their low-energy fermionic excitations behave as massless Dirac particles rather than fermions obeying the usual Schrödinger Hamiltonian. This emergent behavior of Dirac fermions in condensed matter systems defines the unifying framework for a class of materials we call “Dirac materials.” In order to establish this class of materials, we illustrate how Dirac fermions emerge in multiple entirely different condensed matter systems and we discuss how Dirac fermions have been identified experimentally using electron spectroscopy techniques (angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy). As a consequence of their common low-energy excitations, this diverse set of materials shares a significant number of universal properties in the low-energy (infrared) limit. We review these common properties including nodal points in the excitation spectrum, density of states, specific heat, transport, thermodynamic properties, impurity resonances, and magnetic field responses, as well as discuss many-body interaction effects. We further review how the emergence of Dirac excitations is controlled by specific symmetries of the material, such as time-reversal, gauge, and spin–orbit symmetries, and how by breaking these symmetries a finite Dirac mass is generated. We give examples of how the interaction of Dirac fermions with their distinct real material background leads to rich novel physics with common fingerprints such as the suppression of back scattering and impurity-induced resonant states.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate’s phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures – a phenomenon known as the BCS–BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A3C60) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS–BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length (ξ0) and the London penetration depth (λL), even in presence of strong electron correlations.},

  abstract = {Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moir\textbackslash 'e systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.},

  abstract = {While regular flat bands are good for enhancing the density of states and hence the gap, they are detrimental to the superfluid weight. We show that the predicted nontrivial topology of the two lowest flat bands of twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) plays an important role in the enhancement of the superfluid weight and hence of superconductivity. We derive the superfluid weight (phase stiffness) of the TBLG superconducting flat bands with a uniform pairing, and show that it can be expressed as an integral of the Fubini-Study metric of the flat bands. This mirrors results already obtained for nonzero Chern number bands even though the TBLG flat bands have zero Chern number. We further show that the metric integral is lower bounded by the topological C2zT Wilson loop winding number of TBLG flat bands, which renders that the superfluid weight is also bounded by this topological index. In contrast, trivial flat bands have a zero superfluid weight. The superfluid weight is crucial in determining the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature of the superconductor. Based on the transition temperature measured in TBLG experiments, we estimate the topological contribution of the superfluid weight in TBLG.},

The nanomesh superconductors are also less susceptible to thermal fluctuations when compared to nanowire superconductors. Tc values similar to the bulk film are achieved, and the nanomeshes are capable of retaining superconductivity to higher fields relative to the bulk. In addition, periodic oscillations in Tc are observed as a function of field, reflecting the highly ordered nanomesh structure.},

This supercurrent diode effect is also manifested in the polarity dependence of in-plane critical fields induced by a supercurrent. These nonreciprocal effects may be found in polar SrTiO3 film, few-layer MoTe2 in the Td phase, and twisted bilayer graphene in which the valley degree of freedom plays a role analogous to spin.},
