  abstract = {A theory of superconductivity is presented, based on the fact that the interaction between electrons resulting from virtual exchange of phonons is attractive when the energy difference between the electrons states involved is less than the phonon energy, ℏ⁢𝜔. It is favorable to form a superconducting phase when this attractive interaction dominates the repulsive screened Coulomb interaction. The normal phase is described by the Bloch individual-particle model. The ground state of a superconductor, formed from a linear combination of normal state configurations in which electrons are virtually excited in pairs of opposite spin and momentum, is lower in energy than the normal state by amount proportional to an average (ℏ⁢𝜔)2, consistent with the isotope effect. A mutually orthogonal set of excited states in one-to-one correspondence with those of the normal phase is obtained by specifying occupation of certain Bloch states and by using the rest to form a linear combination of virtual pair configurations. The theory yields a second-order phase transition and a Meissner effect in the form suggested by Pippard. Calculated values of specific heats and penetration depths and their temperature variation are in good agreement with experiment. There is an energy gap for individual-particle excitations which decreases from about 3.5⁢𝑘⁢𝑇𝑐 at 𝑇=0°K to zero at 𝑇𝑐. Tables of matrix elements of single-particle operators between the excited-state superconducting wave functions, useful for perturbation expansions and calculations of transition probabilities, are given.},

Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

This mapping is exact for models of correlated electrons in the limit of large lattice coordination (or infinite spatial dimensions). It extends the standard mean-field construction from classical statistical mechanics to quantum problems. We discuss the physical ideas underlying this theory and its mathematical derivation. Various analytic and numerical techniques that have been developed recently in order to analyze and solve the dynamical mean-field equations are reviewed and compared to each other. The method can be used for the determination of phase diagrams (by comparing the stability of various types of long-range order), and the calculation of thermodynamic properties, one-particle Green's functions, and response functions. We review in detail the recent progress in understanding the Hubbard model and the Mott metal-insulator transition within this approach, including some comparison to experiments on three-dimensional transition-metal oxides. We present an overview of the rapidly developing field of applications of this method to other systems. The present limitations of the approach, and possible extensions of the formalism are finally discussed. Computer programs for the numerical implementation of this method are also provided with this article.},

Small arrays of TES sensors have been demonstrated, and kilopixel arrays are under development.

  abstract = {The advent of high-𝑇𝑐 superconductors gave great impetus to the development of thin-film superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) for operation at temperatures up to the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, 77 K. The spectral density of the white flux noise can be calculated analytically for rf SQUIDs and by computer simulation for dc SQUIDs; however, observed noise spectral densities are typically an order of magnitude higher. Low-frequency 1/𝑓 noise from thermally activated vortex motion is a much bigger issue in high-𝑇𝑐 SQUIDs at 77 K than in low-𝑇𝑐 SQUIDs because of the low flux-pinning energies in high-𝑇𝑐 superconductors. The magnitude of the noise depends strongly on the quality of the thin films, and much effort has been expended to improve techniques for depositing YBa2⁢Cu3⁢O7−𝑥 (YBCO) on lattice-matched single-crystal substrates. Substantial effort has also been invested in the development of new types of Josephson junctions, of which grain-boundary junctions are the most widely used in SQUIDs. Appropriate electronic read-out schemes largely eliminate 1/𝑓 noise from fluctuations in the junction critical current in both rf and dc SQUIDs. Typical levels of white flux noise are a few 𝜇⁢𝛷0⁢Hz−1/2 (𝛷0 is the flux quantum). Magnetometers—consisting of a superconducting flux transformer coupled to a SQUID—achieve a white magnetic-field noise as low as 10 fT Hz−1/2, increasing to typically 30 fT Hz−1/2 at 1 Hz. When these devices are operated in an unshielded environment, it is important to minimize the motion of trapped vortices and induced supercurrents, which can greatly increase the 1/𝑓 noise. The ambient noise is far greater than the intrinsic noise of the devices, but can be substantially reduced by various gradiometer configurations. There is now considerable effort to apply high-𝑇𝑐 SQUIDs in magnetocardiology, nondestructive evaluation, microscopy, and geophysics.},

In the present paper a theory is constructed which is free from these faults. We find equations for the ψ-function of the “superconducting electrons” which we introduced and for the vector potential. We have solved these equations for the one-dimensional case (a superconducting half-space and flat plates). The theory makes it possible to express the surface tension in terms of the critical magnetic field and the penetration depth of the magnetic field in superconductors. The penetration depth depends in a strong field on the field strength and this effect will be especially evident in the case of small size superconductors. The destruction of superconductivity in thin plates by a magnetic field is through a second-order phase transition and it only becomes a first-order transition starting with plates of a thickness more than a certain critical thickness. While the critical external magnetic field increases with decreasing thickness of the plates, the critical current for destroying the superconductivity of plates decreases with decreasing thickness.},

It is well known that various metals, when cooled below a certain very low temperature, characteristic of the metal in question, show the strange property of conducting electricity apparently without offering any resistance to the current. This curious phenomenon seems to contradict all our customary conceptions in physics. Particularly striking was the experiment of Kamerlingh Onnes and Tuyn, in which a current was induced in a supraconducting ring of lead and was found to persist there without any measurable decrease for many hours—so long as the low temperature could be maintained. This experiment seems to present a unique case of motion without any friction, whilst we have been accustomed to see in every mechanism an occasion for dissipation of kinetic energy into heat.},

  abstract = {In narrow-band systems electrons can interact with each other via a short-range nonretarded attractive potential. The origin of such an effective local attraction can be polaronic or it can be due to a coupling between electrons and excitons or plasmons. It can also result from purely chemical (electronic) mechanisms, especially in compounds with elements favoring disproportionation of valent states. These mechanisms are discussed and an exhaustive list of materials in which such local electron pairing occurs is given. The authors review the thermodynamic and electromagnetic properties of such systems in several limiting scenarios: (i) Systems with on-site pairing which can be described by the extended negative-𝑈 Hubbard model. The strong-attraction limit of this model, at which it reduces to a system of tightly bound electron pairs (bipolarons) on a lattice, is extensively discussed. These electron pairs behaving as hard-core charged bosons can exhibit a superconducting state analogous to that of superfluid 4He II. The change-over from weak-attraction BCS-like superconductivity to the superfluidity of charged hard-core bosons is examined. (ii) Systems with intersite pairing described by an extended Hubbard model with 𝑈{$>$}0 and nearest-neighbor attraction and/or nearest-neighbor spin exchange as well as correlated hopping. (iii) A mixture of local pairs and itinerant electrons interacting via a charge-exchange mechanism giving rise to a mutually induced superconductivity in both subsystems. The authors discuss to what extent the picture of local pairing, and in particular superfluidity of hard-core charged bosons on a lattice, can be an explanation for the superconducting and normal-state properties of the high-𝑇𝑐 oxides: doped BaBiO3 and the cuprates.},

The most important topological invariant is the Chern number that explains the quantized conductance of the quantum Hall effect. Here we provide a general result for the superfluid weight Ds of a multiband superconductor that is applicable to topologically nontrivial bands with nonzero Chern number C. We find that the integral over the Brillouin-zone of the quantum metric, an invariant calculated from the Bloch functions, gives the superfluid weight in a flat band, with the bound Ds⩾|C|. Thus, even a flat band can carry finite superfluid current, provided the Chern number is nonzero. As an example, we provide Ds for the time-reversal invariant attractive Harper–Hubbard model that can be experimentally tested in ultracold gases. In general, our results establish that a topologically nontrivial flat band is a promising concept for increasing the critical temperature of the superconducting transition.},

  abstract = {The Hubbard model is the simplest model of interacting fermions on a lattice and is of similar importance to correlated electron physics as the Ising model is to statistical mechanics or the fruit fly to biomedical science. Despite its simplicity, the model exhibits an incredible wealth of phases, phase transitions, and exotic correlation phenomena. Although analytical methods have provided a qualitative description of the model in certain limits, numerical tools have shown impressive progress in achieving quantitative accurate results over the past several years. This article gives an introduction to the model, motivates common questions, and illustrates the progress that has been achieved over recent years in revealing various aspects of the correlation physics of the model.},

  abstract = {Universal scaling laws can guide the understanding of new phenomena, and for cuprate high-temperature superconductivity the influential Uemura relation showed, early on, that the maximum critical temperature of superconductivity correlates with the density of the superfluid measured at low temperatures. Here we show that the charge content of the bonding orbitals of copper and oxygen in the ubiquitous CuO2 plane, measured with nuclear magnetic resonance, reproduces this scaling. The charge transfer of the nominal copper hole to planar oxygen sets the maximum critical temperature. A three-dimensional phase diagram in terms of the charge content at copper as well as oxygen is introduced, which has the different cuprate families sorted with respect to their maximum critical temperature. We suggest that the critical temperature could be raised substantially if one were able to synthesize materials that lead to an increased planar oxygen hole content at the expense of that of planar copper.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A\$\_3\$C\$\_\{60\}\$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length (\$\textbackslash xi\_0\$) and the London penetration depth (\$\textbackslash lambda\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{L\}\}\$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.},

  abstract = {In this article we review essential natures of superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems (SCES) from a universal point of view. First we summarize experimental results on SCES by focusing on typical materials such as cuprates, BEDT-TTF organic superconductors, and ruthenate Sr2RuO4. Experimental results on other important SCES, heavy-fermion systems, will be reviewed separately. The formalism to discuss superconducting properties of SCES is shown based on the Dyson–Gor'kov equations. Here two typical methods to evaluate the vertex function are introduced: One is the perturbation calculation up to the third-order terms with respect to electron correlation. Another is the fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) method based on the Baym–Kadanoff conserving approximation. The results obtained by the FLEX method are in good agreement with those obtained by the perturbation calculation. In fact, a reasonable value of Tc for spin-singlet d-wave superconductivity is successfully reproduced by using both methods for SCES such as cuprates and BEDT-TTF organic superconductors. As for Sr2RuO4 exhibiting spin-triplet superconductivity, it is quite difficult to describe the superconducting transition by using the FLEX calculation. However, the superconductivity can be naturally explained by the perturbation calculation, since the third-order terms in the anomalous self-energy play the essential role to realize the triplet superconductivity. Another important purpose of this article is to review anomalous electronic properties of SCES near the Mott transition, since the nature of the normal state in SCES has been one of main issues to be discussed. Especially, we focus on pseudogap phenomena observed in under-doped cuprates and organic superconductors. A variety of scenarios to explain the pseudogap phenomena based on the superconducting and/or spin fluctuations are critically reviewed and examined in comparison with experimental results. According to the recent theory, superconducting fluctuations, inherent in the quasi-two-dimensional and strong-coupling superconductors, are the origin of the pseudogap formation. In these compounds, superconducting fluctuations induce a kind of resonance between the Fermi-liquid quasi-particle and the Cooper-pairing states. This resonance gives rise to a large damping effect of quasi-particles and reduces the spectral weight near the Fermi energy. We discuss the magnetic and transport properties as well as the single-particle spectra in the pseudogap state by the microscopic theory of the superconducting fluctuations. As for heavy-fermion superconductors, experimental results are reviewed and several theoretical analyses on the mechanism are provided based on the same viewpoint as explained above.},
